Let thy ears be attentive, and thy eyes open, to hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee now, night and day, for the children of Israel thy servants: and I confess the sins of the children of Israel, by which they have sinned against thee: I and my father&rsquo;s house have sinned.

## Nehemiah 2:3

And I said to the king: O king, live for ever: why should not my countenance be sorrowful, seeing the city of the place of the sepulchres of my fathers is desolate, and the gates thereof are burnt with fire?

<a id="orgf429422"></a>

## Nehemiah 2:17

Then I said to them: You know the affliction wherein we are, because Jerusalem is desolate, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire: come, and let us build up the walls of Jerusalem, and let us be no longer a reproach.

Now there was a great cry of the people, and of their wives against their brethren the Jews.


<a id="org3d0f4e1"></a>

## Nehemiah 5:2

And there were some that said: Our sons and our daughters are very many: let us take up corn for the price of them, and let us eat and live.


<a id="org19db159"></a>

## Nehemiah 5:3

And there were some that said: Let us mortgage our lands, and our vineyards, and our houses, and let us take corn because of the famine.


<a id="orgebb6179"></a>

## Nehemiah 5:4

And others said: Let us borrow money for the king&rsquo;s tribute, and let us give up our fields and vineyards:


<a id="orgfabee67"></a>

## Nehemiah 5:5

And now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren: and our children as their children. Behold we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters, and some of our daughters are bondwomen already, neither have we wherewith to redeem them, and our fields and our vineyards other men possess.


<a id="org2223bbe"></a>

## Nehemiah 5:6

And I was exceedingly angry when I heard their cry according to these words.


<a id="org1f66135"></a>

## Nehemiah 5:7

And my heart thought with myself: and I rebuked the nobles and magistrates, and said to them: Do you every one exact usury of your brethren? And I gathered together a great assembly against them,


<a id="org2c296f5"></a>

## Nehemiah 5:8

And I said to them: We, as you know, have redeemed according to our ability our brethren the Jews, that were sold to the Gentiles: and will you then sell your brethren, for us to redeem them? And they held their peace, and found not what to answer.


<a id="org36e0236"></a>

## Nehemiah 5:9

And I said to them: The thing you do is not good: why walk you not in the fear of our God, that we be not exposed to the reproaches of the Gentiles our enemies?


<a id="orgfbad86a"></a>

## Nehemiah 5:10

Both I and my brethren, and my servants, have lent money and corn to many: let us all agree not to call for it again; let us forgive the debt that is owing to us.


<a id="org88f3508"></a>

## Nehemiah 5:11

Restore ye to them this day their fields, and their vineyards, and their oliveyards, and their houses: and the hundredth part of the money, and of the corn, the wine, and the oil, which you were wont to exact of them, give it rather for them.


<a id="orgf915ed9"></a>

## Nehemiah 5:12

And they said: We will restore, and we will require nothing of them: and we will do as thou sayest. And I called the priests and took an oath of them, to do according to what I had said.


<a id="orgccad0a6"></a>

## Nehemiah 5:13

Moreover I shook my lap, and said: So may God shake every man that shall not accomplish this word, out of his house, and out of his labours, thus may he be shaken out, and become empty. And all the multitude said: Amen. And they praised God. And the people did according to what was said.


<a id="org280b918"></a>

## Nehemiah 5:14

And from the day, in which the king commanded me to be governor in the land of Juda, from the twentieth year even to the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, for twelve years, I and my brethren did not eat the yearly allowance that was due to the governors.


<a id="org8632f3a"></a>

## Nehemiah 5:15

But the former governors that had been before me, were chargeable to the people, and took of them in bread, and wine, and in money every day forty sicles: and their officers also oppressed the people. But I did not so for the fear of God.


<a id="org405856a"></a>

## Nehemiah 5:16

Moreover I built in the work of the wall, and I bought no land, and all my servants were gathered together to the work.


<a id="org9bc523c"></a>

## Nehemiah 5:17

The Jews also and the magistrates to the number of one hundred and fifty men, were at my table, besides them that came to us from among the nations that were round about us.


<a id="orgbe6aa63"></a>

## Nehemiah 5:18

And there was prepared for me day be day one ox, and six choice rams, besides fowls, and once in ten days I gave store of divers wines, and many other things: yet I did not require my yearly allowance as governor: for the people were very much impoverished.


<a id="org406056c"></a>

## Nehemiah 5:19

Remember me, O my God, for good according to all that I have done for this people. 


<a id="org145da4e"></a>

# Nehemiah 6


<a id="org3f056a4"></a>

## Nehemiah 6:1

And it came to pass, when Sanaballat, and Tobias, and Gossem the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had built the wall, and that there was no breach left in it, (though at that time I had not set up the doors in the gates,)


<a id="org130e43c"></a>

## Nehemiah 6:2

Sanaballat and Gossem sent to me, saying: Come, and let us make a league together in the villages, in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief.


<a id="org984614f"></a>

## Nehemiah 6:3

And I sent messengers to them, saying: I am doing a great work, and I cannot come down, lest it be neglected whilst I come, and go down to you.


<a id="org6b8ab6d"></a>

## Nehemiah 6:4

And they sent to me according to this word, four times: and I answered them after the same manner.


<a id="org28c3b60"></a>

## Nehemiah 6:5

And Sanaballat sent his servant to me the fifth time according to the former word, and he had a letter in his hand written in this manner:


<a id="org4bf9a7e"></a>

## Nehemiah 6:6

It is reported amongst the Gentiles, and Gossem hath said it, that thou and the Jews think to rebel, and therefore thou buildest the wall, and hast a mind to set thyself king over them: for which end


<a id="org868f822"></a>

## Nehemiah 6:7

Thou hast also set up prophets, to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying: There is a king in Judea. The king will hear of these things: therefore come now, that we may take counsel together.


<a id="org5f943b2"></a>

## Nehemiah 6:8

And I sent to them, saying: There is no such thing done as thou sayest: but thou feignest these things out of thy own heart.


<a id="org69ce5fb"></a>

## Nehemiah 6:9

For all these men thought to frighten us, thinking that our hands would cease from the work, and that we would leave off. Wherefore I strengthened my hands the more:


<a id="org0009b72"></a>

## Nehemiah 6:10

And I went into the house of Samaia the son of Delaia, the son of Metabeel privately. And he said: Let us consult together in the house of God in the midst of the temple: and let us shut the doors of the temple, for they will come to kill thee, and in the night they will come to slay thee.


<a id="orga1446d1"></a>

## Nehemiah 6:11

And I said: Should such a man as I flee? and who is there that being as I am, would go into the temple, to save his life? I will not go in.


<a id="org273f789"></a>

## Nehemiah 6:12

And I understood that God had not sent him, but that he had spoken to me as if he had been prophesying, and Tobias, and Sanaballat had hired him.


<a id="orgbd86f80"></a>

## Nehemiah 6:13

For he had taken money, that I being afraid should do this thing, and sin, and they might have some evil to upbraid me withal.


<a id="orgf3e70f2"></a>

## Nehemiah 6:14

Remember me, O Lord, for Tobias and Sanaballat, according to their works of this kind: and Noadias the prophet, and the rest of the prophets that would have put me in fear.


<a id="orgca2e825"></a>

## Nehemiah 6:15

But the wall was finished the five and twentieth day of the month of Elul, in two and fifty days.


<a id="org624cb2a"></a>

## Nehemiah 6:16

And it came to pass when all our enemies heard of it, that all nations which were round about us, were afraid, and were cast down within themselves, for they perceived that this work was the work of God.


<a id="orgaa61bb5"></a>

## Nehemiah 6:17

Moreover in those days many letters were sent by the principal men of the Jews to Tobias, and from Tobias there came letters to them.


<a id="org170ae80"></a>

## Nehemiah 6:18

For there were many in Judea sworn to him, because he was the son in law of Sechenias the son of Area, and Johanan his son had taken to wife the daughter of Mosollam the son of Barachias.


<a id="orgd019732"></a>

## Nehemiah 6:19

And they praised him also before me, and they related my words to him: And Tobias sent letters to put me in fear.

I commanded Hanani my brother, and Hananias ruler of the house of Jerusalem, (for he seemed as a sincere man, and one that feared God above the rest,)


<a id="org2a0cc58"></a>

## Nehemiah 7:3

And I said to them: Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened till the sun be hot. And while they were yet standing by the gates were shut, and barred: and I set watchmen of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one by their courses, and every man over against his house.


<a id="orgacd988c"></a>

## Nehemiah 7:4

And the city was very wide and great, and the people few in the midst thereof, and the houses were not built.

And the priests and the Levites were purified, and they purified the people, and the gates, and the wall.


<a id="orgca275cf"></a>

## Nehemiah 12:31

And I made the princes of Juda go up upon the wall, and I appointed two great choirs to give praise. And they went on the right hand upon the wall toward the dung gate.

And after them went Osaias, and half of the princes of Juda,


<a id="org2072bfb"></a>

And of the sons of the priests with trumpets, Zacharias the son of Jonathan, the son of Semeia, the son of Mathania, the son of Michaia, the son of Zechur, the son of Asaph,


<a id="orgf8dc694"></a>

## Nehemiah 12:35

And his brethren Semeia, and Azareel, Malalai, Galalai, Maai, Nathanael, and Judas, and Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God: and Esdras the scribe before them at the fountain gate.


<a id="org1b83c19"></a>

## Nehemiah 12:36

And they went up over against them by the stairs of the city of David, at the going up of the wall of the house of David, and to the water gate eastward:


<a id="orga1b5ce8"></a>

## Nehemiah 12:37

And the second choir of them that gave thanks went on the opposite side, and I after them, and the half of the people upon the wall, and upon the tower of the furnaces, even to the broad wall,


<a id="org47081af"></a>

## Nehemiah 12:38

And above the gate of Ephraim, and above the old gate, and above the fish gate and the tower of Hananeel, and the tower of Emath, and even to the flock gate: and they stood still in the watch gate.

And the priests, Eliachim, Maasia, Miamin, Michea, Elioenai, Zacharia, Hanania with trumpets,


<a id="orga3c8d9b"></a>

## Nehemiah 12:41

And Maasia, and Semeia, and Eleazar, and Azzi, and Johanan, and Melchia, and Elam, and Ezer. And the singers sung loud, and Jezraia was their overseer:


<a id="orgf89bb40"></a>

## Nehemiah 12:42

And they sacrificed on that day great sacrifices, and they rejoiced: for God had made them joyful with great joy: their wives also and their children rejoiced, and the joy of Jerusalem was heard afar off.


<a id="org8aa6a28"></a>

## Nehemiah 12:43

They appointed also in that day men over the storehouses of the treasure, for the libations, and for the firstfruits, and for the tithes, that the rulers of the city might bring them in by them in honour of thanksgiving, for the priests and Levites: for Juda was joyful in the priests and Levites that assisted.


<a id="org8f1eda2"></a>

## Nehemiah 12:44

And they kept the watch of their God, and the observance of expiation, and the singing men, and the porters, according to the commandment of David, and of Solomon his son.


<a id="org9ff5caf"></a>

## Nehemiah 12:45

For in the days of David and Asaph from the beginning there were chief singers appointed, to praise with canticles, and give thanks to God.


<a id="org1eddd6e"></a>

## Nehemiah 12:46

And all Israel, in the days of Zorobabel, and in the days of Nehemiah gave portions to the singing men, and to the porters, day by day, and they sanctified the Levites, and the Levites sanctified the sons of Aaron. 


<a id="org3bd5639"></a>

# Nehemiah 13


<a id="org9752a89"></a>

## Nehemiah 13:1

And on that day they read in the book of Moses in the hearing of the people: and therein was found written, that the Ammonites and the Moabites should not come in to the church of God for ever:


<a id="orga1846aa"></a>

## Nehemiah 13:2

Because they met not the children of Israel with bread and water: and they hired against them Balaam, to curse them, and our God turned the curse into blessing.


<a id="org3bb49c2"></a>

## Nehemiah 13:3

And it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated every stranger from Israel.


<a id="org26d72ae"></a>

## Nehemiah 13:4

And over this thing was Eliasib the priest, who was set over the treasury of the house of our God, and was near akin to Tobias.


<a id="orgcf0e45e"></a>

## Nehemiah 13:5

And he made him a great storeroom, where before him they laid up gifts, and frankincense, and vessels, and the tithes of the corn, of the wine, and of the oil, the portions of the Levites, and of the singing men, and of the porters, and the firstfruits of the priests.


<a id="orgeb3a43b"></a>

## Nehemiah 13:6

But in all this time I was not in Jerusalem, because in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon, I went to the king, and after certain days I asked the king:


<a id="orgf476455"></a>

## Nehemiah 13:7

And I came to Jerusalem, and I understood the evil that Eliasib had done for Tobias, to make him a storehouse in the courts of the house of God.


<a id="org0cce698"></a>

## Nehemiah 13:8

And it seemed to me exceeding evil. And I cast forth the vessels of the house of Tobias out of the storehouse.


<a id="org7d8789d"></a>

## Nehemiah 13:9

And I commanded and they cleansed again the vessels of the house of God, the sacrifice, and the frankincense.


<a id="org8aad9d2"></a>

## Nehemiah 13:10

And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them: and that the Levites, and the singing men, and they that ministered were fled away every man to his own country:


<a id="org018f65d"></a>

## Nehemiah 13:11

And I pleaded the matter against the magistrates, and said: Why have we forsaken the house of God? And I gathered them together, and I made them to stand in their places.


<a id="org14fa4d6"></a>

## Nehemiah 13:12

And all Juda brought the tithe of the corn, and the wine, and the oil into the storehouses.


<a id="org53affb0"></a>

## Nehemiah 13:13

And we set over the storehouses Selemias the priest, and Sadoc the scribe, and of the Levites Phadaia, and next to them Hanan the son of Zachur, the son of Mathania: for they were approved as faithful, and to them were committed the portions of their brethren.


<a id="org4df9dd8"></a>

## Nehemiah 13:14

Remember me, O my God, for this thing, and wipe not out my kindnesses, which I have done relating to the house of my God and his ceremonies.


<a id="orge026f6b"></a>

## Nehemiah 13:15

In those days I saw in Juda some treading the presses on the sabbath, and carrying sheaves, and lading asses with wine, and grapes, and figs, and all manner of burthens, and bringing them into Jerusalem on the sabbath day. And I charged them that they should sell on a day on which it was lawful to sell.


<a id="org9468de4"></a>

## Nehemiah 13:16

Some Tyrians also dwelt there, who brought fish, and all manner of wares: and they sold them on the sabbaths to the children of Juda in Jerusalem.


<a id="orgb242cf5"></a>

## Nehemiah 13:17

And I rebuked the chief men of Juda, and said to them: What is this evil thing that you are doing, profaning the sabbath day:


<a id="org9806c55"></a>

## Nehemiah 13:18

Did not our fathers do these things, and our God brought all this evil upon us, and upon this city? And you bring more wrath upon Israel by violating the sabbath.


<a id="orgc9a41a7"></a>

## Nehemiah 13:19

And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem were at rest on the sabbath day, I spoke: and they shut the gates, and I commanded that they should not open them till after the sabbath: and I set some of my servants at the gates, that none should bring in burthens on the sabbath day.


<a id="orga7356c8"></a>

## Nehemiah 13:20

So the merchants, and they that sold all kinds of wares, stayed without Jerusalem, once or twice.


<a id="orgf773be3"></a>

## Nehemiah 13:21

And I charged them, and I said to them: Why stay you before the wall? if you do so another time, I will lay hands on you. And from that time they came no more on the sabbath.


<a id="org88b0be8"></a>

## Nehemiah 13:22

I spoke also to the Levites that they should be purified, and should come to keep the gates, and to sanctify the sabbath day: for this also remember me, O my God, and spare me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.


<a id="orgf5ee621"></a>

## Nehemiah 13:23

In those days also I saw Jews that married wives, women of Azotus, and of Ammon, and of Moab.


<a id="orgb5021b3"></a>

## Nehemiah 13:24

And their children spoke half in the speech of Azotus, and could not speak the Jews&rsquo; language, but they spoke according to the language of this and that people.


<a id="org11d4ca0"></a>

## Nehemiah 13:25

And I chid them, and laid my curse upon them. And I beat some of them, and shaved off their hair, and made them swear by God that they would not give their daughters to their sons, nor take their daughters for their sons, nor for themselves, saying:


<a id="orgf37a036"></a>

## Nehemiah 13:26

Did not Solomon king of Israel sin in this kind of thing: and surely among many nations, there was not a king like him, and he was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel: and yet women of other countries brought even him to sin.


<a id="org3f97bae"></a>

## Nehemiah 13:27

And shall we also be disobedient and do all this great evil to transgress against our God, and marry strange women:


<a id="org8ae8db8"></a>

## Nehemiah 13:28

And one of the sons of Joiada the son of Eliasib the high priest, was son in law to Sanaballat the Horonite, and I drove him from me.


<a id="org6d7ad54"></a>

## Nehemiah 13:29

Remember them, O Lord my God, that defile the priesthood, and the law of priests and Levites.


<a id="org41945e0"></a>

## Nehemiah 13:30

So I separated from them all strangers, and I appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites, every man in his ministry:


<a id="org5f2620b"></a>

## Nehemiah 13:31

And for the offering of wood at times appointed, and for the firstfruits: remember me, O my God, unto good. Amen.
