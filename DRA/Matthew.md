<a id="org40329b0"></a>

## Matthew 2:9

Who having heard the king, went their way; and behold the star which they had seen in the East, went before them, until it came and stood over where the child was.

And seeing the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.

Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the ancients? For they wash not their hands when they eat bread.


<a id="orgd3733bc"></a>

## Matthew 15:3

But he answering, said to them: Why do you also transgress the commandment of God for your tradition? For God said:


<a id="org7f405cc"></a>

## Matthew 15:4

Honour thy father and mother: And: He that shall curse father or mother, let him die the death.


<a id="orgd93a94b"></a>

<a id="org40374f1"></a>

Then came his disciples, and said to him: Dost thou know that the Pharisees, when they heard this word, were scandalized?

<a id="orgdbf8815"></a>

<a id="org02201c6"></a>

## Matthew 22:37

Jesus said to him: Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with thy whole heart and with thy whole soul and with thy whole mind.


<a id="orgf7cbf27"></a>

And the Pharisees being gathered together, Jesus asked them,


<a id="orgd22da40"></a>

<a id="orgb407d02"></a>

<a id="org13b3558"></a>

All things therefore whatsoever they shall say to you, observe and do: but according to their works do ye not. For they say, and do not.


<a id="orgad91cd3"></a>

For they bind heavy and insupportable burdens and lay them on men&rsquo;s shoulders: but with a finger of their own they will not move them.


<a id="org52b6ebe"></a>

And they love the first places at feasts and the first chairs in the synagogues,


<a id="org4dad826"></a>

And from the fig tree learn a parable: When the branch thereof is now tender and the leaves come forth, you know that summer is nigh.


<a id="orgce1eeeb"></a>

So you also, when you shall see all these things, know ye that it is nigh, even at the doors.

## Matthew 24:34

Amen I say to you that this generation shall not pass till all these things be done.


<a id="org5426e2b"></a>

## Matthew 24:35

Heaven and earth shall pass: but my words shall not pass.


<a id="org75fb947"></a>

## Matthew 24:36

But of that day and hour no one knoweth: no, not the angels of heaven, but the Father alone.


<a id="orgd98447c"></a>

## Matthew 24:37

And as in the days of Noe, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.


<a id="org1701c80"></a>

## Matthew 24:38

For, as in the days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, even till that day in which Noe entered into the ark:


<a id="org3f83d9b"></a>

## Matthew 24:39

And they knew not till the flood came and took them all away: so also shall the coming of the Son of man be.


<a id="orgb4d8e91"></a>

## Matthew 24:40

Then two shall be in the field. One shall be taken and one shall be left.

## Matthew 24:42

Watch ye therefore, because you know not what hour your Lord will come.


<a id="org0168879"></a>

## Matthew 24:43

## Matthew 24:44

Wherefore be you also ready, because at what hour you know not the Son of man will come.


<a id="org1839cee"></a>

Who, thinkest thou, is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath appointed over his family, to give them meat in season?


<a id="orgaff9093"></a>

## Matthew 24:46

Blessed is that servant, whom when his lord shall come he shall find so doing.


<a id="orgc017d07"></a>

## Matthew 24:47

Amen I say to you: he shall place him over all his goods.


<a id="org9ea9ca3"></a>

## Matthew 24:48

But if that evil servant shall say in his heart: My lord is long a coming:


<a id="orge5532c8"></a>

## Matthew 24:49

And shall begin to strike his fellow servants and shall eat and drink with drunkards:


<a id="org3f68e0f"></a>

## Matthew 24:50

The lord of that servant shall come in a day that he hopeth not and at an hour that he knoweth not:


<a id="orgd9f1180"></a>

## Matthew 24:51

And shall separate him and appoint his portion with the hypocrites. There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. 


<a id="org5a7febf"></a>

# Matthew 25


<a id="orgd5706ea"></a>

## Matthew 25:1

Then shall the kingdom of heaven be like to ten virgins, who taking their lamps went out to meet the bridegroom and the bride.


<a id="org3c2f837"></a>

## Matthew 25:2

And five of them were foolish and five wise.


<a id="orgae4b3d0"></a>

## Matthew 25:3

But the five foolish, having taken their lamps, did not take oil with them.


<a id="org4ec31be"></a>

## Matthew 25:4

But the wise took oil in their vessels with the lamps.


<a id="orgc1a2b39"></a>

## Matthew 25:5

And the bridegroom tarrying, they all slumbered and slept.


<a id="orgbe6aa6e"></a>

## Matthew 25:6

And at midnight there was a cry made: Behold the bridegroom cometh. Go ye forth to meet him.


<a id="org6ea354a"></a>

## Matthew 25:7

Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps.


<a id="orgef6d747"></a>

## Matthew 25:8

And the foolish said to the wise: Give us of your oil, for our lamps are gone out.


<a id="org909fa48"></a>

## Matthew 25:9

The wise answered, saying: Lest perhaps there be not enough for us and for you, go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves.


<a id="org7f9d561"></a>

## Matthew 25:10

Now whilst they went to buy the bridegroom came: and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage. And the door was shut.


<a id="org9f131c3"></a>

## Matthew 25:11

But at last came also the other virgins, saying: Lord, Lord, open to us.


<a id="org33ae26e"></a>

## Matthew 25:12

But he answering said: Amen I say to you, I know you not.


<a id="orgab463c8"></a>

## Matthew 25:13

Watch ye therefore, because you know not the day nor the hour.


<a id="org93ac799"></a>

## Matthew 25:14

For even as a man going into a far country called his servants and delivered to them his goods;


<a id="org3d12aa4"></a>

## Matthew 25:15

And to one he gave five talents, and to another two, and to another one, to every one according to his proper ability: and immediately he took his journey.


<a id="org30b850c"></a>

## Matthew 25:16

And he that had received the five talents went his way and traded with the same and gained other five.


<a id="org6541c1a"></a>

## Matthew 25:17

And in like manner he that had received the two gained other two.


<a id="org5797e97"></a>

## Matthew 25:18

But he that had received the one, going his way, digged into the earth and hid his lord&rsquo;s money.


<a id="org674a243"></a>

## Matthew 25:19

But after a long time the lord of those servants came and reckoned with them.


<a id="orgd24c7cf"></a>

## Matthew 25:20

And he that had received the five talents coming, brought other five talents, saying: Lord, thou didst deliver to me five talents. Behold I have gained other five over and above.


<a id="orgbd18eec"></a>

## Matthew 25:21

His lord said to him: Well done, good and faithful servant, because thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will place thee over many things. Enter thou into the joy of thy lord.


<a id="org6be6038"></a>

## Matthew 25:22

And he also that had received the two talents came and said: Lord, thou deliveredst two talents to me. Behold I have gained other two.


<a id="org97236c8"></a>

## Matthew 25:23

His lord said to him: Well done, good and faithful servant: because thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will place thee over many things. Enter thou into the joy of thy lord.


<a id="orgf80186a"></a>

## Matthew 25:24

But he that had received the one talent, came and said: Lord, I know that thou art a hard man; thou reapest where thou hast not sown and gatherest where thou hast not strewed.


<a id="orgfaed60b"></a>

## Matthew 25:25

And being afraid, I went and hid thy talent in the earth. Behold here thou hast that which is thine.


<a id="org10cbc64"></a>

## Matthew 25:26

And his lord answering, said to him: Wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sow not and gather where I have not strewed.


<a id="org26f128b"></a>

## Matthew 25:27

Thou oughtest therefore to have committed my money to the bankers: and at my coming I should have received my own with usury.


<a id="orgc0c0157"></a>

## Matthew 25:28

Take ye away therefore the talent from him and give it him that hath ten talents.


<a id="org88fa6b4"></a>

## Matthew 25:29

For to every one that hath shall be given, and he shall abound: but from him that hath not, that also which he seemeth to have shall be taken away.


<a id="orgb77c796"></a>

## Matthew 25:30

And the unprofitable servant, cast ye out into the exterior darkness. There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.


<a id="org26827e3"></a>

## Matthew 25:31

And when the Son of man shall come in his majesty, and all the angels with him, then shall he sit upon the seat of his majesty.


<a id="org1b250ff"></a>

## Matthew 25:32

And all nations shall be gathered together before him: and he shall separate them one from another, as the shepherd separateth the sheep from the goats:


<a id="org94830b3"></a>

## Matthew 25:33

And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on his left.


<a id="org42c4be5"></a>

## Matthew 25:34

Then shall the king say to them that shall be on his right hand: Come, ye blessed of my Father, possess you the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.


<a id="org5c8ef91"></a>

## Matthew 25:35

For I was hungry, and you gave me to eat: I was thirsty, and you gave me to drink: I was a stranger, and you took me in:


<a id="org02f506a"></a>

## Matthew 25:36

Naked, and you covered me: sick, and you visited me: I was in prison, and you came to me.


<a id="org049ef86"></a>

## Matthew 25:37

Then shall the just answer him, saying: Lord, when did we see thee hungry and fed thee: thirsty and gave thee drink?


<a id="org87136dc"></a>

## Matthew 25:38

Or when did we see thee a stranger and took thee in? Or naked and covered thee?


<a id="org6086288"></a>

## Matthew 25:39

Or when did we see thee sick or in prison and came to thee?


<a id="org6dd7d30"></a>

## Matthew 25:40

And the king answering shall say to them: Amen I say to you, as long as you did it to one of these my least brethren, you did it to me.


<a id="org048c840"></a>

## Matthew 25:41

Then he shall say to them also that shall be on his left hand: Depart from me, you cursed, into everlasting fire, which was prepared for the devil and his angels.


<a id="org20cfddf"></a>

## Matthew 25:42

For I was hungry and you gave me not to eat: I was thirsty and you gave me not to drink.


<a id="orgefee151"></a>

## Matthew 25:43

I was a stranger and you took me not in: naked and you covered me not: sick and in prison and you did not visit me.


<a id="orga9bc884"></a>

## Matthew 25:44

Then they also shall answer him, saying: Lord, when did we see thee hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and did not minister to thee?


<a id="org5dd32e8"></a>

## Matthew 25:45

Then he shall answer them, saying: Amen: I say to you, as long as you did it not to one of these least, neither did you do it to me.


<a id="orgb89c174"></a>

## Matthew 25:46

And these shall go into everlasting punishment: but the just, into life everlasting. 


<a id="org037d21b"></a>

# Matthew 26


<a id="org8e15084"></a>

## Matthew 26:1

And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended all these words, he said to his disciples:


<a id="org28e8a1c"></a>

## Matthew 26:2

You know that after two days shall be the pasch: and the Son of man shall be delivered up to be crucified.


<a id="org45896da"></a>

## Matthew 26:3

Then were gathered together the chief priests and ancients of the people, into the court of the high priest, who was called Caiphas:


<a id="orgbd49e09"></a>

## Matthew 26:4

And they consulted together that by subtilty they might apprehend Jesus and put him to death.


<a id="org5fde4ee"></a>

## Matthew 26:5

But they said: Not on the festival day, lest perhaps there should be a tumult among the people.


<a id="org2b7fd6d"></a>

## Matthew 26:6

And when Jesus was in Bethania, in the house of Simon the leper,


<a id="org5fd7746"></a>

## Matthew 26:7

There came to him a woman having an alabaster box of precious ointment and poured it on his head as he was at table.


<a id="org0736133"></a>

## Matthew 26:8

And the disciples seeing it had indignation, saying: To what purpose is this waste?


<a id="orgec9c099"></a>

## Matthew 26:9

For this might have been sold for much and given to the poor.


<a id="org967c542"></a>

## Matthew 26:10

And Jesus knowing it, said to them: Why do you trouble this woman? For she hath wrought a good work upon me.


<a id="org708e00f"></a>

## Matthew 26:11

For the poor you have always with you: but me you have not always.


<a id="org67fee6f"></a>

## Matthew 26:12

For she in pouring this ointment on my body hath done it for my burial.


<a id="orgd566bfc"></a>

## Matthew 26:13

Amen I say to you, wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, that also which she hath done shall be told for a memory of her.


<a id="org53d11bc"></a>

## Matthew 26:14

Then went one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, to the chief priests.


<a id="org9035231"></a>

## Matthew 26:15

And said to them: What will you give me, and I will deliver him unto you? But they appointed him thirty pieces of silver.


<a id="orgbf53b91"></a>

## Matthew 26:16

And from thenceforth he sought opportunity to betray him.


<a id="org339ad76"></a>

## Matthew 26:17

And on the first day of the Azymes, the disciples came to Jesus, saying: Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the pasch?


<a id="orgfed6fe9"></a>

## Matthew 26:18

But Jesus said: Go ye into the city to a certain man and say to him: The master saith, My time is near at hand. With thee I make the pasch with my disciples.


<a id="org8f1c039"></a>

## Matthew 26:19

And the disciples did as Jesus appointed to them: and they prepared the pasch.


<a id="orgb512300"></a>

## Matthew 26:20

But when it was evening, he sat down with his twelve disciples.


<a id="org20a1e23"></a>

## Matthew 26:21

And whilst they were eating, he said: Amen I say to you that one of you is about to betray me.


<a id="orge78f2b2"></a>

## Matthew 26:22

And they being very much troubled began every one to say: Is it I, Lord?


<a id="org82e29f3"></a>

## Matthew 26:23

But he answering said: He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, he shall betray me.


<a id="org2d8004e"></a>

## Matthew 26:24

The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him. But woe to that man by whom the Son of man shall be betrayed. It were better for him, if that man had not been born.


<a id="orgbdd4c74"></a>

## Matthew 26:25

And Judas that betrayed him answering, said: Is it I, Rabbi? He saith to him: Thou hast said it.


<a id="org6f4f26e"></a>

## Matthew 26:26

And whilst they were at supper, Jesus took bread and blessed and broke and gave to his disciples and said: Take ye and eat. This is my body.


<a id="org6b22b25"></a>

## Matthew 26:27

And taking the chalice, he gave thanks and gave to them, saying: Drink ye all of this.


<a id="org752458b"></a>

## Matthew 26:28

For this is my blood of the new testament, which shall be shed for many unto remission of sins.


<a id="org5931fa8"></a>

## Matthew 26:29

And I say to you, I will not drink from henceforth of this fruit of the vine until that day when I shall drink it with you new in the kingdom of my Father.


<a id="org0573da8"></a>

## Matthew 26:30

And a hymn being said, they went out unto mount Olivet.


<a id="org8259267"></a>

## Matthew 26:31

Then Jesus saith to them: All you shall be scandalized in me this night. For it is written: I will strike the shepherd: and the sheep of the flock shall be dispersed.


<a id="org231a1c9"></a>

## Matthew 26:32

But after I shall be risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.


<a id="org4fdbfef"></a>

## Matthew 26:33

And Peter answering, said to him: Although all shall be scandalized in thee, I will never be scandalized.


<a id="orgafe55b4"></a>

## Matthew 26:34

Jesus said to him: Amen I say to thee that in this night before the cock crow, thou wilt deny me thrice.


<a id="org1abc907"></a>

## Matthew 26:35

Peter saith to him: Yea, though I should die with thee, I will not deny thee. And in like manner said all the disciples.


<a id="orgaf0ba1b"></a>

## Matthew 26:36

Then Jesus came with them into a country place which is called Gethsemani. And he said to his disciples: Sit you here, till I go yonder and pray.


<a id="orgb7bc3c0"></a>

## Matthew 26:37

And taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to grow sorrowful and to be sad.


<a id="org641b286"></a>

## Matthew 26:38

Then he saith to them: My soul is sorrowful even unto death. Stay you here and watch with me.


<a id="org375964c"></a>

## Matthew 26:39

And going a little further, he fell upon his face, praying and saying: My Father, if it be possible, let this chalice pass from me. Nevertheless, not as I will but as thou wilt.


<a id="org595d4bb"></a>

## Matthew 26:40

And he cometh to his disciples and findeth them asleep. And he saith to Peter: What? Could you not watch one hour with me?


<a id="org6751777"></a>

## Matthew 26:41

Watch ye: and pray that ye enter not into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.


<a id="org33c6a2d"></a>

## Matthew 26:42

Again the second time, he went and prayed, saying: My Father, if this chalice may not pass away, but I must drink it, thy will be done.


<a id="org5079e36"></a>

## Matthew 26:43

And he cometh again and findeth them sleeping: for their eyes were heavy.


<a id="org64aaac2"></a>

## Matthew 26:44

And leaving them, he went again: and he prayed the third time, saying the selfsame word.


<a id="org79ce69b"></a>

## Matthew 26:45

Then he cometh to his disciples and said to them: Sleep ye now and take your rest. Behold the hour is at hand: and the Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of sinners.


<a id="org32af330"></a>

## Matthew 26:46

Rise: let us go. Behold he is at hand that will betray me.


<a id="orgd054b82"></a>

## Matthew 26:47

As he yet spoke, behold Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests and the ancients of the people.


<a id="org5d42324"></a>

## Matthew 26:48

And he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying: Whomsoever I shall kiss, that is he. Hold him fast.


<a id="org033fe0a"></a>

## Matthew 26:49

And forthwith coming to Jesus, he said: Hail, Rabbi. And he kissed him.


<a id="orga03cbae"></a>

## Matthew 26:50

And Jesus said to him: Friend, whereto art thou come? Then they came up and laid hands on Jesus and held him.


<a id="org879ad04"></a>

## Matthew 26:51

And behold one of them that were with Jesus, stretching forth his hand, drew out his sword: and striking the servant of the high priest, cut off his ear.


<a id="org50e2225"></a>

## Matthew 26:52

Then Jesus saith to him: Put up again thy sword into its place: for all that take the sword shall perish with the sword.


<a id="org35abf06"></a>

## Matthew 26:53

Thinkest thou that I cannot ask my Father, and he will give me presently more than twelve legions of angels?


<a id="org60f00b5"></a>

## Matthew 26:54

How then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that so it must be done?


<a id="org84b8765"></a>

## Matthew 26:55

In that same hour, Jesus said to the multitudes: You are come out, as it were to a robber, with swords and clubs to apprehend me. I sat daily with you, teaching in the temple: and you laid not hands on me.


<a id="org844fdba"></a>

## Matthew 26:56

Now all this was done that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then the disciples, all leaving him, fled.


<a id="org4704d2f"></a>

## Matthew 26:57

But they holding Jesus led him to Caiphas the high priest, where the scribes and the ancients were assembled.


<a id="org2154d62"></a>

## Matthew 26:58

And Peter followed him afar off, even to the court of the high priest, And going in, he sat with the servants, that he might see the end.


<a id="org8898d1e"></a>

## Matthew 26:59

And the chief priests and the whole council sought false witness against Jesus, that they might put him to death.


<a id="orga3ecfa5"></a>

## Matthew 26:60

And they found not, whereas many false witnesses had come in. And last of all there came two false witnesses:


<a id="org27b0ac9"></a>

## Matthew 26:61

And they said: This man said, I am able to destroy the temple of God and after three days to rebuild it.


<a id="org4a16e4e"></a>

## Matthew 26:62

And the high priest rising up, said to him: Answerest thou nothing to the things which these witness against thee?


<a id="orge448d0d"></a>

## Matthew 26:63

But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest said to him: I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us if thou be the Christ the Son of God.


<a id="orgd632ce8"></a>

## Matthew 26:64

Jesus saith to him: Thou hast said it. Nevertheless I say to you, hereafter you shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of the power of God and coming in the clouds of heaven.


<a id="org3ca9016"></a>

## Matthew 26:65

Then the high priest rent his garments, saying: He hath blasphemed: What further need have we of witnesses? Behold, now you have heard the blasphemy.


<a id="org39e3e01"></a>

## Matthew 26:66

What think you? But they answering, said: He is guilty of death.


<a id="org6755e96"></a>

## Matthew 26:67

Then did they spit in his face and buffeted him. And others struck his face with the palms of their hands,


<a id="orgf7b2b76"></a>

## Matthew 26:68

Saying: Prophesy unto us, O Christ. Who is he that struck thee?


<a id="orgef96fc2"></a>

## Matthew 26:69

But Peter sat without in the court. And there came to him a servant maid, saying: Thou also wast with Jesus the Galilean.


<a id="org3593676"></a>

## Matthew 26:70

But he denied before them all, saying: I know not what thou sayest.


<a id="org125feb7"></a>

## Matthew 26:71

And as he went out of the gate, another maid saw him; and she saith to them that were there: This man also was with Jesus of Nazareth.


<a id="orgbdd4468"></a>

## Matthew 26:72

And again he denied with an oath: I know not the man.


<a id="org6d44ab7"></a>

## Matthew 26:73

And after a little while, they came that stood by and said to Peter: Surely thou also art one of them. For even thy speech doth discover thee.


<a id="org7c27230"></a>

## Matthew 26:74

Then he began to curse and to swear that he knew not the man. And immediately the cock crew.


<a id="orgd12d46d"></a>

## Matthew 26:75

And Peter remembered the word of Jesus which he had said: Before the cock crow, thou wilt deny me thrice. And going forth, he wept bitterly.

## Matthew 27:2

And they brought him bound and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor.


<a id="orge23d0a2"></a>

## Matthew 27:3

Then Judas, who betrayed him, seeing that he was condemned, repenting himself, brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and ancients,


<a id="orgae7ba54"></a>

## Matthew 27:4

Saying: I have sinned in betraying innocent blood. But they said: What is that to us? Look thou to it.


<a id="orgca2fa28"></a>

## Matthew 27:5

And casting down the pieces of silver in the temple, he departed and went and hanged himself with an halter.


<a id="org16a4c9e"></a>

## Matthew 27:6

But the chief priests having taken the pieces of silver, said: It is not lawful to put them into the corbona, because it is the price of blood.


<a id="org2536c17"></a>

## Matthew 27:7

And after they had consulted together, they bought with them the potter&rsquo;s field, to be a burying place for strangers.


<a id="orgcf7765d"></a>

## Matthew 27:8

For this cause that field was called Haceldama, that is, the field of blood, even to this day.


<a id="org5c19a95"></a>

## Matthew 27:9

Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremias the prophet, saying: And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was prized, whom they prized of the children of Israel.

<a id="org657e60f"></a>

<a id="orge25e3bd"></a>

<a id="orgd807409"></a>

## Matthew 27:19

<a id="orgadcad8e"></a>

<a id="org49cf3e0"></a>

## Matthew 27:25

And the whole people answering, said: His blood be upon us and upon our children.


<a id="org7a1fae1"></a>

## Matthew 27:26

And stripping him, they put a scarlet cloak about him.


<a id="orgcf76783"></a>

## Matthew 27:29

## Matthew 27:30

And spitting upon him, they took the reed and struck his head.


<a id="org6341bde"></a>

<a id="org24d1a7d"></a>

## Matthew 27:32

And going out, they found a man of Cyrene, named Simon: him they forced to take up his cross.


<a id="orgab501f9"></a>

## Matthew 27:33

And they came to the place that is called Golgotha, which is the place of Calvary.


<a id="org00c0ef1"></a>

## Matthew 27:34

<a id="orgb4915bc"></a>

## Matthew 27:35

## Matthew 27:36

And they sat and watched him.


<a id="org48e6d93"></a>

<a id="org61192f0"></a>

## Matthew 27:39

<a id="org5477a28"></a>

## Matthew 27:40

And saying: Vah, thou that destroyest the temple of God and in three days dost rebuild it: save thy own self. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross.


<a id="orgfce146c"></a>

## Matthew 27:41

In like manner also the chief priests, with the scribes and ancients, mocking said:


<a id="org16ba2cf"></a>

## Matthew 27:42

He saved others: himself he cannot save. If he be the king of Israel, let him now come down from the cross: and we will believe him.


<a id="org5379070"></a>

## Matthew 27:43

He trusted in God: let him now deliver him if he will have him. For he said: I am the Son of God.


<a id="org67c0cd9"></a>

## Matthew 27:44

And the selfsame thing the thieves also that were crucified with him reproached him with.


<a id="orgbe629d1"></a>

## Matthew 27:47

And some that stood there and heard said: This man calleth Elias.


<a id="org9bd7dd0"></a>

## Matthew 27:48

And immediately one of them running took a sponge and filled it with vinegar and put it on a reed and gave him to drink.


<a id="org2358e49"></a>

## Matthew 27:49

And the others said: Let be. Let us see whether Elias will come to deliver him.


<a id="org5b9c726"></a>

## Matthew 27:50

<a id="org6cdebd7"></a>

<a id="org3c93577"></a>

<a id="orgdbf0771"></a>

## Matthew 27:64
