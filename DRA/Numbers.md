Whether it be man or woman, cast ye them out of the camp, lest they defile it when I shall dwell with you,

<a id="orgac8e233"></a>

<a id="orga83bb76"></a>

## Numbers 5:13

Shall have slept with another man, and her husband cannot discover it, but the adultery is secret, and cannot be proved by witnesses, because she was not found in the adultery:

If the spirit of jealousy stir up the husband against his wife, who either is defiled, or is charged with false suspicion,

## Numbers 5:15

## Numbers 5:19

And he shall adjure her, and shall say: If another man hath not slept with thee, and if thou be not defiled by forsaking thy husband&rsquo;s bed, these most bitter waters, on which I have heaped curses, shall not hurt thee.


<a id="org0cc404e"></a>

## Numbers 5:20

But if thou hast gone aside from thy husband, and art defiled, and hast lain with another man:


<a id="org4d67489"></a>

## Numbers 5:21

<a id="orgdc60219"></a>

## Numbers 5:22

Let the cursed waters enter into thy belly, and may thy womb swell and thy thigh rot. And the woman shall answer, Amen, amen.

To take a handful of the sacrifice of that which is offered, and burn it upon the altar: and so give the most bitter waters to the woman to drink.

## Numbers 5:28

But if she be not defiled, she shall not be hurt, and shall bear children.


<a id="orgea66091"></a>

<a id="orgf001e2f"></a>

## Numbers 6:6

All the time of his consecration he shall not go in to any dead,


<a id="org2f2abb3"></a>

## Numbers 6:7

<a id="orgc4b23ce"></a>

## Numbers 6:12

And shall consecrate to the Lord the days of his separation, offering a lamb of one year for sin: yet so that the former days be made void, because his sanctification was profaned.


<a id="org53429e0"></a>

## Numbers 6:13

This is the law of consecration. When the days which he had determined by vow shall be expired, he shall bring him to the door of the tabernacle of the covenant,


<a id="org11002ce"></a>

## Numbers 6:14

And shall offer his oblation to the Lord: one he lamb of a year old without blemish for a holocaust, and one ewe lamb of a year old without blemish for a sin offering, and one ram without blemish for a victim of peace offering,

## Numbers 6:18

Then shall the hair of the consecration of the Nazarite, be shaved off before the door of the tabernacle of the covenant: and he shall take his hair, and lay it upon the fire, which is under the sacrifice of the peace offerings.


<a id="org2a63850"></a>

## Numbers 6:19

And shall take the boiled shoulder of the ram, and one unleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and he shall deliver them into the hands of the Nazarite, after his head is shaven.

<a id="org37aff5d"></a>

## Numbers 6:21

This is the law of the Nazarite, when he hath vowed his oblation to the Lord in the time of his consecration, besides those things which his hand shall find, according to that which he had vowed in his mind, so shall he do for the fulfilling of his sanctification.

## Numbers 12:7

But it is not so with my servant Moses who is most faithful in all my house:


<a id="org02426cf"></a>

## Numbers 12:8

He said to Moses: I beseech thee, my lord, lay not upon us this sin, which we have foolishly committed:


<a id="orge7b069f"></a>

## Numbers 12:12

## Numbers 14:19

Forgive, I beseech thee, the sins of this people, according to the greatness of thy mercy, as thou hast been merciful to them from their going out of Egypt unto this place.

And by him hath commanded you from the day that he began to command and thenceforward,


<a id="org088e06f"></a>

## Numbers 15:24

## Numbers 15:25

## Numbers 20:20

But he answered: Thou shalt not pass. And immediately he came forth to meet them with an infinite multitude, and a strong hand,


<a id="org2bcd138"></a>

## Numbers 20:22

And when they had removed the camp from Cades, they came to mount Hor, which is in the borders of the land of Edom:


<a id="org5462c30"></a>

## Numbers 20:23

Where the Lord spoke to Moses:


<a id="org65d6a1b"></a>

## Numbers 20:24

Let Aaron, saith he, go to his people: for he shall not go into the land which I have given the children of Israel, because he was incredulous to my words, at the waters of contradiction.


<a id="org5ce3663"></a>

## Numbers 20:25

Take Aaron and his son with him, and bring them up into mount Hor:


<a id="org8b46aba"></a>

And when thou hast stripped the father of his vesture, thou shalt vest therewith Eleazar his son: Aaron shall be gathered to his people, and die there.


<a id="org0c7108b"></a>

Moses did as the Lord had commanded: and they went up into mount Hor before all the multitude.

<a id="orgcf92ab3"></a>

## Numbers 21:2

<a id="org310e25c"></a>

## Numbers 21:3

And the Lord heard the prayers of Israel, and delivered up the Chanaanite, and they cut them off and destroyed their cities: and they called the name of that place Horma, that is to say, Anathema.

## Numbers 21:4

And they marched from mount Hor, by the way that leadeth to the Red Sea, to compass the land of Edom. And the people began to be weary of their journey and labour:


<a id="org013d35a"></a>

## Numbers 21:5

And speaking against God and Moses, they said: Why didst thou bring us out of Egypt, to die in the wilderness? There is no bread, nor have we any waters: our soul now loatheth this very light food.

## Numbers 21:6

Wherefore the Lord sent among the people fiery serpents, which bit them and killed many of them.


<a id="org56fec0f"></a>

## Numbers 21:7

<a id="orgeac7e08"></a>

## Numbers 21:13

Which they left and encamped over against Arnon, which is in the desert and standeth out on the borders of the Amorrhite. For Arnon is the border of Moab, dividing the Moabites and the Amorrhites.


<a id="org769c6a0"></a>

## Numbers 21:14

Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the Lord: As he did in the Red Sea, so will he do in the streams of Arnon.


<a id="orgae0a614"></a>

<a id="org28b5b4e"></a>

## Numbers 21:17

Then Israel sung this song: Let the well spring up. They sung thereto:


<a id="orga089666"></a>

## Numbers 21:18

From Mathana unto Nahaliel: from Nahaliel unto Bamoth.


<a id="orga32a4a2"></a>

<a id="orgd0f66c6"></a>

## Numbers 21:22

I beseech thee that I may have leave to pass through thy land: we will not go aside into the fields or the vineyards, we will not drink waters of the wells, we will go the king&rsquo;s highway, till we be past thy borders.


<a id="orgb7df813"></a>

## Numbers 21:23

And he would not grant that Israel should pass by his borders: but rather gathering an army, went forth to meet them in the desert, and came to Jasa and fought against them.


<a id="org4451958"></a>

## Numbers 21:24

And he was slain by them with the edge of the sword, and they possessed his land from the Arnon unto the Jeboc, and to the confines of the children of Ammon: for the borders of the Ammonites, were kept with a strong garrison.

## Numbers 21:25

So Israel took all his cities, and dwelt in the cities of the Amorrhite, to wit, in Hesebon, and in the villages thereof.


<a id="org778987c"></a>

## Numbers 21:26

<a id="org36caa50"></a>

## Numbers 21:27

Therefore it is said in the proverb: Come into Hesebon, let the city of Sehon be built and set up:


<a id="org02a267a"></a>

## Numbers 21:28

A fire is gone out of Hesebon, a flame from the city of Sehon, and hath consumed Ar of the Moabites, and the inhabitants of the high places of the Arnon.


<a id="orgd70540a"></a>

## Numbers 21:29

Woe to thee Moab: thou art undone, O people of Chamos. He hath given his sons to flight, and his daughters into captivity to Sehon the king of the Amorrhites.


<a id="org022de3c"></a>

## Numbers 21:30

Their yoke is perished from Hesebon unto Dibon, they came weary to Nophe, and unto Medaba.


<a id="orgfa255ad"></a>

So Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorrhite.


<a id="orgf8e019c"></a>

And the Lord said to Moses: Fear him not, for I have delivered him and all his people, and his country into thy hand: and thou shalt do to him as thou didst to Sehon the king of the Amorrhites, the inhabitant of Hesebon.


<a id="orgbe20d0e"></a>

## Numbers 21:35

So they slew him also with his sons, and all his people, not letting any one escape, and they possessed his land. 


<a id="org766ed43"></a>

# Numbers 22


<a id="orgaa80b1d"></a>

## Numbers 22:1

And they went forward and encamped in the plains of Moab, over against where Jericho is situate beyond the Jordan.


<a id="orgec85f35"></a>

## Numbers 22:2

And Balac the son of Sephor, seeing all that Israel had done to the Amorrhite,


<a id="org80f150d"></a>

## Numbers 22:3

And that the Moabites were in great fear of him, and were not able to sustain his assault,


<a id="orgfd8aa10"></a>

## Numbers 22:4

He said to the elders of Madian: So will this people destroy all that dwell in our borders, as the ox is wont to eat the grass to the very roots. Now he was at that time king in Moab.


<a id="orgf2ae0dd"></a>

## Numbers 22:5

He sent therefore messengers to Balaam the son of Beor, a soothsayer, who dwelt by the river of the land of the children of Ammon, to call him, and to say: Behold a people is come out of Egypt, that hath covered the face of the earth, sitting over against me.


<a id="org6e298fb"></a>

## Numbers 22:6

Come therefore, and curse this people, because it is mightier than I: if by any means I may beat them and drive them out of my land: for I know that he whom thou shalt bless is blessed, and he whom thou shalt curse is cursed.


<a id="org7d8ce87"></a>

## Numbers 22:7

And the ancients of Moab, and the elders of Madian, went with the price of divination in their hands. And where they were come to Balaam, and had told him all the words of Balac:


<a id="org41da335"></a>

## Numbers 22:8

He answered: Tarry here this night and I will answer whatsoever the Lord shall say to me. And while they stayed with Balaam, God came and said to him:


<a id="orgcf50698"></a>

## Numbers 22:9

What mean these men that are with thee?


<a id="org7d8fc98"></a>

## Numbers 22:10

He answered: Balac the son of Sephor king of the Moabites hath sent to me,


<a id="orgca54e80"></a>

## Numbers 22:11

Saying: Behold a people that is come out of Egypt, hath covered the face of the land: come and curse them, if by any means I may fight with them and drive them away.


<a id="orgcba568c"></a>

## Numbers 22:12

And God said to Balaam: Thou shalt not go with them, nor shalt thou curse the people: because it is blessed.


<a id="org4354378"></a>

## Numbers 22:13

And he rose in the morning and said to the princes: Go into your country, because the Lord hath forbid me to come with you.


<a id="org8a524e1"></a>

## Numbers 22:14

The princes returning, said to Balac: Balaam would not come with us.


<a id="orgf8da37d"></a>

## Numbers 22:15

Then he sent many more and more noble than he had sent before:


<a id="orgf368661"></a>

## Numbers 22:16

Who, when they were come to Balaam, said: Thus saith Balac the son of Sephor, Delay not to come to me:


<a id="orgc4e42ac"></a>

## Numbers 22:17

For I am ready to honour thee, and will give thee whatsoever thou wilt: come and curse this people.


<a id="org209072e"></a>

## Numbers 22:18

Balaam answered: If Balac would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot alter the word of the Lord my God, to speak either more or less.


<a id="org3ef4152"></a>

## Numbers 22:19

I pray you to stay here this night also, that I may know what the Lord will answer me once more.


<a id="orgb515936"></a>

## Numbers 22:20

God therefore came to Balaam in the night, and said to him: If these men be come to call thee, arise and go with them: yet so, that thou do what I shall command thee.


<a id="org0374176"></a>

## Numbers 22:21

Balaam arose in the morning, and saddling his ass went with them.


<a id="orge862acc"></a>

## Numbers 22:22

And God was angry. And an angel of the Lord stood in the way against Balaam, who sat on the ass, and had two servants with him.


<a id="org0ec02a5"></a>

## Numbers 22:23

The ass seeing the angel standing in the way, with a drawn sword, turned herself out of the way, and went into the field. And when Balaam beat her, and had a mind to bring her again to the way,


<a id="org7f108d1"></a>

## Numbers 22:24

The angel stood in a narrow place between two walls, wherewith the vineyards were enclosed.


<a id="orgb6d637e"></a>

## Numbers 22:25

And the ass seeing him, thrust herself close to the wall, and bruised the foot of the rider. But he beat her again:


<a id="org428cae1"></a>

## Numbers 22:26

And nevertheless the angel going on to a narrow place, where there was no way to turn aside either to the right hand or to the left, stood to meet him.


<a id="org74d93bd"></a>

## Numbers 22:27

And when the ass saw the angel standing, she fell under the feet of the rider: who being angry beat her sides more vehemently with a staff.


<a id="org570fa36"></a>

## Numbers 22:28

And the Lord opened the mouth of the ass, and she said: What have I done to thee? Why strikest thou me, lo, now this third time?


<a id="org5d70aa7"></a>

## Numbers 22:29

Balaam answered: Because thou hast deserved it, and hast served me ill: I would I had a sword that I might kill thee.


<a id="orga9f3e21"></a>

## Numbers 22:30

The ass said: Am not I thy beast, on which thou hast been always accustomed to ride until this present day? tell me if I ever did the like thing to thee. But he said: Never.


<a id="orga186418"></a>

## Numbers 22:31

Forthwith the Lord opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel standing in the way with a drawn sword, and he worshipped him falling flat on the ground.


<a id="org926cc78"></a>

## Numbers 22:32

And the angel said to him: Why beatest thou thy ass these three times? I am come to withstand thee, because thy way is perverse, and contrary to me:


<a id="orgc9e490c"></a>

## Numbers 22:33

And unless the ass had turned out of the way, giving place to me who stood against thee, I had slain thee, and she should have lived.


<a id="orgf89744d"></a>

## Numbers 22:34

Balaam said: I have sinned, not knowing that thou didst stand against me: and now if it displease thee that I go, I will return.


<a id="org56fa83c"></a>

## Numbers 22:35

The angel said: Go with these men, and see thou speak no other thing than what I shall command thee. He went therefore with the princes.


<a id="orgb26a80c"></a>

## Numbers 22:36

And when Balac heard it he came forth to meet him in a town of the Moabites, that is situate in the uttermost borders of Arnon.


<a id="orgfcbda24"></a>

## Numbers 22:37

And he said to Balaam: I sent messengers to call thee, why didst thou not come immediately to me? was it because I am not able to reward thy coming?


<a id="org2db69d6"></a>

## Numbers 22:38

He answered him: Lo, here I am: shall I have power to speak any other thing but that which God shall put in my mouth?


<a id="orga313489"></a>

## Numbers 22:39

So they went on together, and came into a city, that was in the uttermost borders of his kingdom.


<a id="orgace708d"></a>

## Numbers 22:40

And when Balac had killed oxen and sheep, he sent presents to Balaam, and to the princes that were with him.


<a id="org031afd3"></a>

## Numbers 22:41

And when morning was come, he brought him to the high places of Baal, and he beheld the uttermost part of the people. 


<a id="orgbb05fd3"></a>

# Numbers 23


<a id="org38f3bc2"></a>

## Numbers 23:1

And Balaam said to Balac: Build me here seven altars, and prepare as many calves, and the same number of rams.


<a id="orga990bd5"></a>

## Numbers 23:2

And when he had done according to the word of Balaam, they laid together a calf and a ram upon every altar.


<a id="org5222749"></a>

## Numbers 23:3

And Balaam said to Balac: Stand a while by thy burnt offering, until I go, to see if perhaps the Lord will meet me, and whatsoever he shall command, I will speak to thee.


<a id="org7aca0f4"></a>

## Numbers 23:4

And when he was gone with speed, God met him. And Balaam speaking to him, said: I have erected seven altars, and have laid on everyone a calf and a ram.


<a id="org4979ef2"></a>

## Numbers 23:5

And the Lord put the word in his mouth, and said: Return to Balac, and thus shalt thou speak.


<a id="org3846124"></a>

## Numbers 23:6

Returning he found Balac standing by his burnt offering, with all the princes of the Moabites:


<a id="org8d135de"></a>

## Numbers 23:7

And taking up his parable, he said: Balac king of the Moabites hath brought me from Aram, from the mountains of the east: Come, said he, and curse Jacob: make haste and detest Israel.


<a id="orgee44187"></a>

## Numbers 23:8

How shall I curse him, whom God hath not cursed? By what means should I detest him, whom the Lord detesteth not?


<a id="org045a0a0"></a>

## Numbers 23:9

I shall see him from the tops of the rocks, and shall consider him from the hills. This people shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations.


<a id="org18483db"></a>

## Numbers 23:10

Who can count the dust of Jacob, and know the number of the stock of Israel? Let my soul die the death of the just, and my last end be like to them.


<a id="org7913b50"></a>

## Numbers 23:11

And Balac said to Balaam: What is this that thou dost? I sent for thee to curse my enemies: and thou contrariwise blessest them.


<a id="org43dfd05"></a>

## Numbers 23:12

He answered him: Can I speak any thing else but what the Lord commandeth?


<a id="orgfc6335f"></a>

## Numbers 23:13

Balac therefore said: Come with me to another place from whence thou mayest see part of Israel, and canst not see them all: curse them from thence.


<a id="org506850b"></a>

## Numbers 23:14

And when he had brought him to a high place, upon the top of mount Phasga, Balaam built seven altars, and laying on every one a calf and a ram,


<a id="orgcce163e"></a>

## Numbers 23:15

He said to Balac: Stand here by thy burnt offering while I go to meet him.


<a id="orgcea7687"></a>

## Numbers 23:16

And when the Lord had met him, and had put the word in his mouth, he said: Return to Balac, and thus shalt thou say to him.


<a id="org077c57d"></a>

## Numbers 23:17

Returning he found him standing by his burnt sacrifice, and the princes of the Moabites with him. And Balac said to him: What hath the Lord spoken?


<a id="orgeb5005c"></a>

## Numbers 23:18

But he taking up his parable, said: Stand, O Balac, and give ear: hear, thou son of Sephor:


<a id="org1ed2e4b"></a>

## Numbers 23:19

God is not a man, that he should lie, nor is the son of man, that he should be changed. Hath he said then, and will he not do? hath he spoken, and will he not fulfil?


<a id="org0062537"></a>

## Numbers 23:20

I was brought to bless, the blessing I am not able to hinder.


<a id="org06f9cfc"></a>

## Numbers 23:21

There is no idol in Jacob, neither is there an image god to be seen in Israel. The Lord his God is with him, and the sound of the victory of the king in him.


<a id="org4fede39"></a>

## Numbers 23:22

God hath brought him out of Egypt, whose strength is like to the rhinoceros.


<a id="org2b19338"></a>

## Numbers 23:23

There is no soothsaying in Jacob, nor divination in Israel. In their times it shall be told to Jacob and to Israel what God hath wrought.


<a id="orgf9b5905"></a>

## Numbers 23:24

Behold the people shall rise up as a lioness, and shall lift itself up as a lion: it shall not lie down till it devour the prey, and drink the blood of the slain.


<a id="orgac8e116"></a>

## Numbers 23:25

And Balac said to Balaam: Neither curse, nor bless him.


<a id="orgba51c0d"></a>

## Numbers 23:26

And he said: Did I not tell thee, that whatsoever God should command me, that I would do?


<a id="org74f2f16"></a>

## Numbers 23:27

And Balac said to him: Come and I will bring thee to another place; if peradventure it please God that thou mayest curse them from thence.


<a id="org1aba626"></a>

## Numbers 23:28

And when he had brought him upon the top of mount Phogor, which looketh towards the wilderness,


<a id="orgfafcd8a"></a>

## Numbers 23:29

Balaam said to him: Build me here seven altars, and prepare as many calves, and the same number of rams.


<a id="orgd580879"></a>

## Numbers 23:30

Balac did as Balaam had said: and he laid on every altar, a calf and a ram. 


<a id="org4c6cc55"></a>

# Numbers 24


<a id="org29b592f"></a>

## Numbers 24:1

And when Balaam saw that it pleased the Lord that he should bless Israel, he went not as he had gone before, to seek divination: but setting his face towards the desert,


<a id="org99536f3"></a>

## Numbers 24:2

And lifting up his eyes, he saw Israel abiding in their tents by their tribes: and the spirit of God rushing upon him,


<a id="org676bd76"></a>

## Numbers 24:3

He took up his parable and said: Balaam the son of Beor hath said: The man hath said, whose eye is stopped up:


<a id="org2d8aaff"></a>

## Numbers 24:4

The bearer of the words of God hath said, he that hath beheld the vision of the Almighty, he that falleth, and so his eyes are opened:


<a id="orged94496"></a>

## Numbers 24:5

How beautiful are thy tabernacles O Jacob, and thy tents, O Israel!


<a id="org093d1bc"></a>

## Numbers 24:6

As woody valleys, as watered gardens near the rivers, as tabernacles which the Lord hath pitched, as cedars by the waterside.


<a id="org90ab025"></a>

## Numbers 24:7

Water shall flow out of his bucket, and his seed shall be in many waters. For Agag his king shall be removed, and his kingdom shall be taken away.


<a id="org3b0b918"></a>

## Numbers 24:8

God hath brought him out of Egypt, whose strength is like to the rhinoceros. They shall devour the nations that are his enemies, and break their bones, and pierce them with arrows.


<a id="org6b637cd"></a>

## Numbers 24:9

Lying down he hath slept as a lion, and as a lioness, whom none shall dare to rouse. He that blesseth thee, shall also himself be blessed: he that curseth thee shall be reckoned accursed.


<a id="org2b5fcac"></a>

## Numbers 24:10

And Balac being angry against Balaam, clapped his hands together and said: I called thee to curse my enemies, and thou on the contrary hast blessed them three times.


<a id="org5b0dbdf"></a>

## Numbers 24:11

Return to thy place. I had determined indeed greatly to honour thee, but the Lord hath deprived thee of the honour designed for thee.


<a id="org5fb02b4"></a>

## Numbers 24:12

Balaam made answer to Balac: Did I not say to thy messengers, whom thou sentest to me:


<a id="orge1fc196"></a>

## Numbers 24:13

If Balac would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the Lord my God, to utter any thing of my own head either good or evil: but whatsoever the Lord shall say, that I will speak?


<a id="org16d2fe5"></a>

## Numbers 24:14

But yet going to my people, I will give thee counsel, what this people shall do to thy people in the latter days.


<a id="org44e86f3"></a>

## Numbers 24:15

Therefore taking up his parable, again he said: Balaam the son of Beor hath said: The man whose eye is stopped up, hath said:


<a id="org425df8b"></a>

## Numbers 24:16

The hearer of the words of God hath said, who knoweth the doctrine of the Highest, and seeth the visions of the Almighty, who falling hath his eyes opened:


<a id="org79909cc"></a>

## Numbers 24:17

I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not near. A STAR SHALL RISE out of Jacob and a sceptre shall spring up from Israel: and shall strike the chiefs of Moab, and shall waste all the children of Seth


<a id="orgf3f1ba7"></a>

## Numbers 24:18

And he shall possess Idumea: the inheritance of Seir shall come to their enemies, but Israel shall do manfully.

<a id="org10981bd"></a>

## Numbers 35:6

And among the cities, which you shall give to the Levites, six shall be separated for refuge to fugitives, that he who hath shed blood may flee to them: and besides these there shall be other forty-two cities,

<a id="orge2587b6"></a>

## Numbers 35:11

Determine what cities shall be for the refuge of fugitives, who have shed blood against their will.

These things shall be perpetual, and for an ordinance in all your dwellings.

## Numbers 36:2

The Lord hath commanded thee, my lord, that thou shouldst divide the land by lot to the children of Israel, and that thou shouldst give to the daughters of Salphaad our brother the possession due to their father:


<a id="org79e3b68"></a>

## Numbers 36:3

And so it shall come to pass, that when the jubilee, the is, the fiftieth year of remission, is come, the distribution made by the lots shall be confounded, and the possession of the one shall pass to the others.

Lest the possession of the children of Israel be mingled from tribe to tribe. For all men shall marry wives of their own tribe and kindred:

## Numbers 36:8

And all women shall take husbands of the same tribe: that the inheritance may remain in the families.


<a id="org0389af3"></a>

## Numbers 36:9

And that the tribes be not mingled one with another, but remain so


<a id="orga37fa9a"></a>
