# Luke 1


<a id="org95d2bfb"></a>

## Luke 1:1

Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a narration of the things that have been accomplished among us,


<a id="orge4bd82b"></a>

## Luke 1:2

According as they have delivered them unto us, who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word:


<a id="org0905eec"></a>

## Luke 1:3

It seemed good to me also, having diligently attained to all things from the beginning, to write to thee in order, most excellent Theophilus,


<a id="orgefbe873"></a>

## Luke 1:4

That thou mayest know the verity of those words in which thou hast been instructed.


<a id="org480b768"></a>

## Luke 1:5

There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judea, a certain priest named Zachary, of the course of Abia: and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name Elizabeth.


<a id="org2a239ce"></a>

## Luke 1:6

And they were both just before God, walking in all the commandments and justifications of the Lord without blame.


<a id="org058e010"></a>

## Luke 1:7

And they had no son, for that Elizabeth was barren: and they both were well advanced in years.


<a id="orgcb2b9fe"></a>

## Luke 1:8

And it came to pass, when he executed the priestly function in the order of his course before God,


<a id="org1d9ef49"></a>

## Luke 1:9

According to the custom of the priestly office, it was his lot to offer incense, going into the temple of the Lord.


<a id="orgd002d02"></a>

## Luke 1:10

And all the multitude of the people was praying without, at the hour of incense.


<a id="org3f9318e"></a>

## Luke 1:11

And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord, standing on the right side of the altar of incense.


<a id="orgff35fac"></a>

## Luke 1:12

And Zachary seeing him, was troubled: and fear fell upon him.


<a id="orgfaf4a00"></a>

## Luke 1:13

But the angel said to him: Fear not, Zachary, for thy prayer is heard: and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son. And thou shalt call his name John.


<a id="orgabfe2bc"></a>

## Luke 1:14

And thou shalt have joy and gladness: and many shall rejoice in his nativity.


<a id="orgadd3630"></a>

## Luke 1:15

For he shall be great before the Lord and shall drink no wine nor strong drink: and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother&rsquo;s womb.


<a id="orgcc9429c"></a>

## Luke 1:16

And he shall convert many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God.


<a id="orgd03ac4a"></a>

## Luke 1:17

And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias: that he may turn the hearts of the fathers unto the children and the incredulous to the wisdom of the just, to prepare unto the Lord a perfect people.


<a id="org8dd8245"></a>

## Luke 1:18

And Zachary said to the angel: Whereby shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is advanced in years.


<a id="org3e68aa9"></a>

## Luke 1:19

And the angel answering, said to him: I am Gabriel, who stand before God and am sent to speak to thee and to bring thee these good tidings.


<a id="org2f7ad24"></a>

## Luke 1:20

And behold, thou shalt be dumb and shalt not be able to speak until the day wherein these things shall come to pass: because thou hast not believed my words, which shall be fulfilled in their time.


<a id="org416c588"></a>

## Luke 1:21

And the people were waiting for Zachary: and they wondered that he tarried so long in the temple.


<a id="org83f9e8f"></a>

## Luke 1:22

And when he came out, he could not speak to them: and they understood that he had seen a vision in the temple. And he made signs to them and remained dumb.


<a id="orgb849ef8"></a>

## Luke 1:23

And it came to pass, after the days of his office were accomplished, he departed to his own house.


<a id="org896f6db"></a>

## Luke 1:24

And after those days, Elizabeth his wife conceived and hid herself five months, saying:


<a id="org99d31ee"></a>

## Luke 1:25

Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he hath had regard to take away my reproach among men.


<a id="org52f4c20"></a>

## Luke 1:26

And in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God into a city of Galilee, called Nazareth,


<a id="org218a0c0"></a>

## Luke 1:27

To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David: and the virgin&rsquo;s name was Mary.


<a id="org2190574"></a>

## Luke 1:28

And the angel being come in, said unto her: Hail, full of grace, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women.


<a id="org96fc02c"></a>

## Luke 1:29

Who having heard, was troubled at his saying and thought with herself what manner of salutation this should be.


<a id="orgb493840"></a>

## Luke 1:30

And the angel said to her: Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found grace with God.


<a id="orgb45a69e"></a>

## Luke 1:31

Behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and shalt bring forth a son: and thou shalt call his name Jesus.


<a id="org347752f"></a>

## Luke 1:32

He shall be great and shall be called the Son of the Most High. And the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of David his father: and he shall reign in the house of Jacob for ever.


<a id="org6905584"></a>

## Luke 1:33

And of his kingdom there shall be no end.


<a id="orgc5e7c13"></a>

## Luke 1:34

And Mary said to the angel: How shall this be done, because I know not man?


<a id="orgd558094"></a>

## Luke 1:35

And the angel answering, said to her: The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the Most High shall overshadow thee. And therefore also the Holy which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.


<a id="org3cd84e7"></a>

## Luke 1:36

And behold thy cousin Elizabeth, she also hath conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her that is called barren.


<a id="orge3b1e0d"></a>

## Luke 1:37

Because no word shall be impossible with God.


<a id="org580eabd"></a>

## Luke 1:38

And Mary said: Behold the handmaid of the Lord: be it done to me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.


<a id="org37b63b4"></a>

## Luke 1:39

And Mary rising up in those days, went into the hill country with haste into a city of Juda.


<a id="orgf6d0e35"></a>

## Luke 1:40

And she entered into the house of Zachary and saluted Elizabeth.


<a id="orga9d19fb"></a>

## Luke 1:41

And it came to pass that when Elizabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the infant leaped in her womb. And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost.


<a id="orgccfd685"></a>

## Luke 1:42

And she cried out with a loud voice and said: Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.


<a id="org3274d40"></a>

## Luke 1:43

And whence is this to me that the mother of my Lord should come to me?


<a id="org373b77a"></a>

## Luke 1:44

For behold as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in my ears, the infant in my womb leaped for joy.


<a id="org12e0edb"></a>

## Luke 1:45

And blessed art thou that hast believed, because those things shall be accomplished that were spoken to thee by the Lord.


<a id="orgc14bb49"></a>

## Luke 1:46

And Mary said: My soul doth magnify the Lord.


<a id="org3a843fb"></a>

## Luke 1:47

And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.


<a id="orga60ead3"></a>

## Luke 1:48

Because he hath regarded the humility of his handmaid: for behold from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.


<a id="org9f3d358"></a>

## Luke 1:49

Because he that is mighty hath done great things to me: and holy is his name.


<a id="orge3d62fa"></a>

## Luke 1:50

And his mercy is from generation unto generations, to them that fear him.


<a id="org05b6584"></a>

## Luke 1:51

He hath shewed might in his arm: he hath scattered the proud in the conceit of their heart.


<a id="orgb411758"></a>

## Luke 1:52

He hath put down the mighty from their seat and hath exalted the humble.


<a id="org120a1ba"></a>

## Luke 1:53

He hath filled the hungry with good things: and the rich he hath sent empty away.


<a id="org5036565"></a>

## Luke 1:54

He hath received Israel his servant, being mindful of his mercy.


<a id="org94f74c4"></a>

## Luke 1:55

As he spoke to our fathers: to Abraham and to his seed for ever.


<a id="org4cb943b"></a>

## Luke 1:56

And Mary abode with her about three months. And she returned to her own house.


<a id="orgea1972e"></a>

## Luke 1:57

Now Elizabeth&rsquo;s full time of being delivered was come: and she brought forth a son.


<a id="orga2dcbb7"></a>

## Luke 1:58

And her neighbors and kinsfolks heard that the Lord had shewed his great mercy towards her: and they congratulated with her.


<a id="org8f43684"></a>

## Luke 1:59

And it came to pass that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child: and they called him by his father&rsquo;s name Zachary.


<a id="orgb0accdb"></a>

## Luke 1:60

And his mother answering, said: Not so. But he shall be called John.


<a id="orge82dd2d"></a>

## Luke 1:61

And they said to her: There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name.


<a id="org1edd9e1"></a>

## Luke 1:62

And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called.


<a id="org0712f1d"></a>

## Luke 1:63

And demanding a writing table, he wrote, saying: John is his name. And they all wondered.


<a id="orgf23a0fc"></a>

## Luke 1:64

And immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue loosed: and he spoke, blessing God.


<a id="org9aa4938"></a>

## Luke 1:65

And fear came upon all their neighbours: and all these things were noised abroad over all the hill country of Judea.


<a id="orgf260639"></a>

## Luke 1:66

And all they that had heard them laid them up in their heart, saying: What an one, think ye, shall this child be? For the hand of the Lord was with him.


<a id="orge972123"></a>

## Luke 1:67

And Zachary his father was filled with the Holy Ghost. And he prophesied, saying:


<a id="org7280a3c"></a>

## Luke 1:68

Blessed be the Lord God of Israel: because he hath visited and wrought the redemption of his people.


<a id="org1607352"></a>

## Luke 1:69

And hath raised up an horn of salvation to us, in the house of David his servant.


<a id="orge21cd96"></a>

## Luke 1:70

As he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets, who are from the beginning.


<a id="org816ce7e"></a>

## Luke 1:71

Salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all that hate us.


<a id="orgbcb8513"></a>

## Luke 1:72

To perform mercy to our fathers and to remember his holy testament.


<a id="org438e2e3"></a>

## Luke 1:73

The oath, which he swore to Abraham our father, that he would grant to us.


<a id="org3d3031e"></a>

## Luke 1:74

That being delivered from the hand of our enemies, we may serve him without fear:


<a id="org53b9a84"></a>

## Luke 1:75

In holiness and justice before him, all our days.


<a id="org5837466"></a>

<a id="orgd78078d"></a>

And behold, there was a certain man before him that had the dropsy.


<a id="orgd18e114"></a>

<a id="orgc9a63f8"></a>

And answering them, he said: Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fall into a pit and will not immediately draw him out, on the sabbath day?


<a id="org63c7bd5"></a>

## Luke 14:6

And they could not answer him to these things.


<a id="orgeb37ac7"></a>

## Luke 14:7

And he spoke a parable also to them that were invited, marking how they chose the first seats at the table, saying to them:


<a id="org5f99e4c"></a>

## Luke 14:8

When thou art invited to a wedding, sit not down in the first place, lest perhaps one more honourable than thou be invited by him:


<a id="org1eacc31"></a>

## Luke 14:9

And he that invited thee and him, come and say to thee: Give this man place. And then thou begin with shame to take the lowest place.


<a id="org14d7b6d"></a>

## Luke 14:10

But when thou art invited, go, sit down in the lowest place; that when he who invited thee cometh, he may say to thee: Friend, go up higher. Then shalt thou have glory before them that sit at table with thee.


<a id="orgc5937b6"></a>

## Luke 14:11

Because every one that exalteth himself shall be humbled: and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.


<a id="orgd02403f"></a>

## Luke 14:12

And he said to him also that had invited him: When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends nor thy brethren nor thy kinsmen nor thy neighbours who are rich; lest perhaps they also invite thee again, and a recompense be made to thee.


<a id="org47ff94e"></a>

## Luke 14:13

But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame and the blind.


<a id="org0a4496f"></a>

## Luke 14:14

And thou shalt be blessed, because they have not wherewith to make thee recompense: for recompense shall be made thee at the resurrection of the just.


<a id="org90f35d7"></a>

## Luke 14:15

When one of them that sat at table with him had heard these things, he said to him: Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God.


<a id="orgaea4f70"></a>

## Luke 14:16

But he said to him: A certain man made a great supper and invited many.


<a id="org86e3601"></a>

<a id="orgc26f0d4"></a>

## Luke 14:18

<a id="org0bcfc98"></a>

## Luke 14:21

And the servant returning, told these things to his lord. Then the master of the house, being angry, said to his servant: Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city; and bring in hither the poor and the feeble and the blind and the lame.


<a id="org9bb8138"></a>

## Luke 14:22

And the servant said: Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded; and yet there is room.


<a id="orgc55e59e"></a>

## Luke 14:23

And the Lord said to the servant: Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled.


<a id="org914051e"></a>

## Luke 14:24

But I say unto you that none of those men that were invited shall taste of my supper.


<a id="orgd641bc4"></a>

## Luke 14:25

And there went great multitudes with him. And turning, he said to them:


<a id="org32bd3d5"></a>

## Luke 14:26

If any man come to me, and hate not his father and mother and wife and children and brethren and sisters, yea and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.


<a id="orgdbade75"></a>

## Luke 14:27

And whosoever doth not carry his cross and come after me cannot be my disciple.


<a id="orgcb999ac"></a>

## Luke 14:28

For which of you, having a mind to build a tower, doth not first sit down and reckon the charges that are necessary, whether he have wherewithal to finish it:


<a id="org08f2247"></a>

## Luke 14:29

Lest, after he hath laid the foundation and is not able to finish it, all that see it begin to mock him,


<a id="orge8ef01a"></a>

## Luke 14:30

Saying: This man began to build and was not able to finish.


<a id="orge8067b9"></a>

## Luke 14:31

Or, what king, about to go to make war against another king, doth not first sit down and think whether he be able, with ten thousand, to meet him that, with twenty thousand, cometh against him?


<a id="org95705a3"></a>

## Luke 14:32

Or else, while the other is yet afar off, sending an embassy, he desireth conditions of peace.


<a id="org55f9310"></a>

## Luke 14:33

So likewise every one of you that doth not renounce all that he possesseth cannot be my disciple.

## Luke 15:2

And the Pharisees and the scribes murmured, saying: This man receiveth sinners and eateth with them.


<a id="org263e8da"></a>

## Luke 15:3

And he spoke to them this parable, saying:


<a id="orgdae5779"></a>

## Luke 15:4

What man of you that hath an hundred sheep, and if he shall lose one of them, doth he not leave the ninety-nine in the desert and go after that which was lost, until he find it?


<a id="orgb64e653"></a>

## Luke 15:5

And when he hath found it, lay it upon his shoulders, rejoicing?


<a id="orgcd195d4"></a>

## Luke 15:6

And coming home, call together his friends and neighbours, saying to them: Rejoice with me, because I have found my sheep that was lost?


<a id="org0e3b00f"></a>

## Luke 15:7

I say to you that even so there shall be joy in heaven upon one sinner that doth penance, more than upon ninety-nine just who need not penance.


<a id="org07b43dc"></a>

## Luke 15:8

Or what woman having ten groats, if she lose one groat, doth not light a candle and sweep the house and seek diligently until she find it?


<a id="orgbf807e9"></a>

## Luke 15:9

And when she hath found it, call together her friends and neighbours, saying: Rejoice with me, because I have found the groat which I had lost.

## Luke 15:11

And he said: A certain man had two sons.


<a id="orgbde719b"></a>

## Luke 15:12

And the younger of them said to his father: Father, give me the portion of substance that falleth to me. And he divided unto them his substance.


<a id="orgf66dc79"></a>

## Luke 15:13

And not many days after, the younger son, gathering all together, went abroad into a far country: and there wasted his substance, living riotously.


<a id="orge450be0"></a>

## Luke 15:14

And after he had spent all, there came a mighty famine in that country: and he began to be in want.


<a id="orgaefbccd"></a>

## Luke 15:15

And he went and cleaved to one of the citizens of that country. And he sent him into his farm to feed swine.


<a id="orgc93440b"></a>

## Luke 15:16

And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him.


<a id="org44612fc"></a>

## Luke 15:17

And returning to himself, he said: How many hired servants in my father&rsquo;s house abound with bread, and I here perish with hunger!


<a id="orgaa4ca43"></a>

## Luke 15:18

I will arise and will go to my father and say to him: Father, I have sinned against heaven and before thee.


<a id="orgb37a231"></a>

## Luke 15:19

I am not worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.


<a id="org6fde88c"></a>

## Luke 15:20

And rising up, he came to his father. And when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him and was moved with compassion and running to him fell upon his neck and kissed him.


<a id="orgbcdb863"></a>

## Luke 15:21

And the son said to him: Father: I have sinned against heaven and before thee I am not now worthy to be called thy son.


<a id="org2e2cc07"></a>

## Luke 15:22

And the father said to his servants: Bring forth quickly the first robe and put it on him: and put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet.


<a id="org3993942"></a>

## Luke 15:23

And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it: and let us eat and make merry:


<a id="org4052f95"></a>

## Luke 15:24

Because this my son was dead and is come to life again, was lost and is found. And they began to be merry.


<a id="org2d4438c"></a>

<a id="org9eb0b86"></a>

And he said to him: Thy brother is come and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe.


<a id="org1a580cf"></a>

## Luke 15:28

And he was angry and would not go in. His father therefore coming out began to entreat him.


<a id="org0e8d3f2"></a>

## Luke 15:29

And he answering, said to his father: Behold, for so many years do I serve thee and I have never transgressed thy commandment: and yet thou hast never given me a kid to make merry with my friends.


<a id="orgf9916e0"></a>

## Luke 15:30

But as soon as this thy son is come, who hath devoured his substance with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.


<a id="org9d9b5de"></a>

## Luke 15:31

But he said to him: Son, thou art always with me; and all I have is thine.


<a id="orgbf111d5"></a>

## Luke 15:32

But it was fit that we should make merry and be glad: for this thy brother was dead and is come to life again; he was lost, and is found.

# Luke 16


<a id="org2c05121"></a>

<a id="org3b3d229"></a>

## Luke 16:2

And he called him and said to him: How is it that I hear this of thee? Give an account of thy stewardship: for now thou canst be steward no longer.


<a id="org23b4b69"></a>

## Luke 16:3

And the steward said within himself: What shall I do, because my lord taketh away from me the stewardship? To dig I am not able; to beg I am ashamed.


<a id="orgdbf15c7"></a>

## Luke 16:4

I know what I will do, that when I shall be removed from the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.


<a id="orgc98b2ad"></a>

## Luke 16:5

Therefore, calling together every one of his lord&rsquo;s debtors, he said to the first: How much dost thou owe my lord?


<a id="org0d7a060"></a>

## Luke 16:6

But he said: An hundred barrels of oil. And he said to him: Take thy bill and sit down quickly and write fifty.


<a id="org065c0ad"></a>

## Luke 16:7

Then he said to another: And how much dost thou owe? Who said: An hundred quarters of wheat. He said to him: Take thy bill and write eighty.


<a id="org920b767"></a>

And the lord commended the unjust steward, forasmuch as he had done wisely: for the children of this world are wiser in their generation than the children of light.


<a id="org0750a97"></a>

## Luke 16:9

And I say to you: Make unto you friends of the mammon of iniquity: that when you shall fail, they may receive you into everlasting dwellings.


<a id="org7123a01"></a>

## Luke 16:10

He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in that which is greater: and he that is unjust in that which is little is unjust also in that which is greater.


<a id="orgd1569ee"></a>

## Luke 16:11

If then you have not been faithful in the unjust mammon, who will trust you with that which is the true?


<a id="orgacd3301"></a>

## Luke 16:12

And if you have not been faithful in that which is another&rsquo;s, who will give you that which is your own?


<a id="org9ba2ce4"></a>

## Luke 16:13

No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one and love the other: or he will hold to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.


<a id="orgf8c5bbe"></a>

## Luke 16:14

Now the Pharisees, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him.


<a id="org6c648c1"></a>

And he said to them: you are they who justify yourselves before men, but God knoweth your hearts. For that which is high to men is an abomination before God.


<a id="orgcf336c0"></a>

## Luke 16:16

The law and the prophets were until John. From that time the kingdom of God is preached: and every one useth violence towards it.


<a id="org011a06c"></a>

## Luke 16:17

And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass than one tittle of the law to fall.


<a id="org1ecc2ba"></a>

## Luke 16:18

Every one that putteth away his wife and marrieth another committeth adultery: and he that marrieth her that is put away from her husband committeth adultery.

There was a certain rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen and feasted sumptuously every day.

And there was a certain beggar, named Lazarus, who lay at his gate, full of sores,


<a id="org551d7fb"></a>

## Luke 16:21

Desiring to be filled with the crumbs that fell from the rich man&rsquo;s table. And no one did give him: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.


<a id="org6544a31"></a>

## Luke 16:22

And it came to pass that the beggar died and was carried by the angels into Abraham&rsquo;s bosom. And the rich man also died: and he was buried in hell.

## Luke 16:23

And lifting up his eyes when he was in torments, he saw Abraham afar off and Lazarus in his bosom:


<a id="org8c5151a"></a>

## Luke 16:24

<a id="org1522cba"></a>

## Luke 16:25

And Abraham said to him: Son, remember that thou didst receive good things in thy lifetime, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted and thou art tormented.


<a id="orgdf63bda"></a>

And besides all this, between us and you, there is fixed a great chaos: so that they who would pass from hence to you cannot, nor from thence come hither.


<a id="orgd123add"></a>

## Luke 16:27

And he said: Then, father, I beseech thee that thou wouldst send him to my father&rsquo;s house, for I have five brethren,

## Luke 16:28

That he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torments.


<a id="org16f791a"></a>

## Luke 16:29

And Abraham said to him: They have Moses and the prophets. Let them hear them.


<a id="orgd15f150"></a>

## Luke 16:30

But he said: No, father Abraham: but if one went to them from the dead, they will do penance.


<a id="org63ee5f8"></a>

## Luke 16:31

And he said to him: If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they believe, if one rise again from the dead.

And he said to his disciples: It is impossible that scandals should not come. But woe to him through whom they come!


<a id="org9d6e96a"></a>

## Luke 17:2

It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and he cast into the sea, than that he should scandalize one of these little ones.


<a id="org6d47bc7"></a>

## Luke 17:3

Take heed to yourselves. If thy brother sin against thee, reprove him: and if he do penance, forgive him.


<a id="org28ee13b"></a>

And if he sin against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day be converted unto thee, saying: I repent: forgive him.

And the apostles said to the Lord: Increase our faith.


<a id="org94c1ec8"></a>

## Luke 17:6

<a id="orgf71b9cf"></a>

## Luke 17:7

But which of you, having a servant ploughing or feeding cattle, will say to him, when he is come from the field: Immediately go. Sit down to meat.


<a id="org72dfc86"></a>

## Luke 17:8

And will not rather say to him: Make ready my supper and gird thyself and serve me, whilst I eat and drink; and afterwards thou shalt eat and drink?

## Luke 17:9

Doth he thank that servant for doing the things which he commanded him?


<a id="org4616968"></a>

## Luke 17:10

There is no one found to return and give glory to God, but this stranger.

<a id="orgce1eecf"></a>

And he would not for a long time. But afterwards he said within himself: Although I fear not God nor regard man,


<a id="org491f6ca"></a>

## Luke 18:5

Yet because this widow is troublesome to me, I will avenge her, lest continually coming she weary me.

<a id="org120e59b"></a>

And Jesus answering, said to them: I will also ask you one thing. Answer me:

## Luke 20:4

The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men?


<a id="orgc7f68c0"></a>

<a id="org34d8938"></a>

But if we say, of men: the whole people will stone us. For they are persuaded that John was a prophet.

And they answered that they knew not whence it was.


<a id="org684250b"></a>

<a id="orgabe178b"></a>

And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard. Who, beating him, sent him away empty.


<a id="org17b0cc2"></a>

And again he sent another servant. But they beat him also and, treating him reproachfully, sent him away empty.

And again he sent the third: and they wounded him also and cast him out.


<a id="org8304f85"></a>

Then the lord of the vineyard said: What shall I do? I will send my beloved son. It may be, when they see him, they will reverence him.


<a id="org4ac915e"></a>

## Luke 20:14

Whom, when the husbandmen saw, they thought within themselves, saying: This is the heir. Let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.


<a id="orgcf16f32"></a>

## Luke 20:15

So casting him out of the vineyard, they killed him. What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do to them?


<a id="org1ac49b8"></a>

## Luke 20:16

He will come and will destroy these husbandmen and will give the vineyard to others. Which they hearing, said to him: God forbid.


<a id="org1b3cce1"></a>

But he looking on them, said: What is this then that is written, The stone, which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner?


<a id="org4322e76"></a>

## Luke 20:18

Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be bruised: and upon whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.


<a id="org53a629f"></a>

## Luke 20:20

And being upon the watch, they sent spies, who should feign themselves just, that they might take hold of him in his words, that they might deliver him up to the authority and power of the governor.


<a id="org1c80e2d"></a>

## Luke 20:21

## Luke 20:32

Last of all the woman died also.


<a id="org47d726a"></a>

## Luke 20:34

And Jesus said to them: The children of this world marry and are given in marriage:


<a id="org77edf00"></a>
