## Acts 4:1

And as they were speaking to the people the priests and the officer of the temple and the Sadducees came upon them,


<a id="org8ea5ede"></a>

## Acts 4:2

Being grieved that they taught the people and preached in Jesus the resurrection from the dead:


<a id="org9bc502e"></a>

## Acts 4:3

And they laid hands upon them and put them in hold till the next day: for it was now evening.

This is the stone which was rejected by you the builders, which is become the head of the corner.

<a id="org35b23b8"></a>

Now seeing the constancy of Peter and of John, understanding that they were illiterate and ignorant men, they wondered: and they knew them that they had been with Jesus.

## Acts 4:28

To do what thy hand and thy counsel decreed to be done.


<a id="org51bd1a8"></a>

## Acts 4:29

And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants that with all confidence they may speak thy word,


<a id="org6d4ce2b"></a>

## Acts 4:30

By stretching forth thy hand to cures and signs and wonders, to be done by the name of thy holy Son, Jesus.

## Acts 16:14

And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, one that worshipped God, did hear: whose heart the Lord opened to attend to those things which were said by Paul.

## Acts 16:15

And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought us, saying: If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house and abide there. And she constrained us.


<a id="org7e3ff81"></a>

## Acts 16:16

And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain girl having a pythonical spirit met us, who brought to her masters much gain by divining.


<a id="orgf5f1102"></a>

## Acts 16:17

This same following Paul and us, cried out, saying: These men are the servants of the Most High God, who preach unto you the way of salvation.


<a id="org2eab7cd"></a>

## Acts 16:18

And this she did many days. But Paul being grieved, turned and said to the spirit: I command thee, in the name of Jesus Christ, to go from her. And he went out the same hour.


<a id="org4faab7c"></a>

## Acts 16:19

But her masters, seeing that the hope of their gain was gone, apprehending Paul and Silas, brought them into the market place to the rulers.


<a id="org8f9a713"></a>

## Acts 16:20

And presenting them to the magistrates, they said: These men disturb our city, being Jews:


<a id="org914b908"></a>

## Acts 16:21

And preach a fashion which it is not lawful for us to receive nor observe, being Romans.


<a id="org9f92ee3"></a>

## Acts 16:22

And the people ran together against them: and the magistrates, rending off their clothes, commanded them to be beaten with rods.


<a id="org4ee5b64"></a>

## Acts 16:23

And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the gaoler to keep them diligently.

<a id="org87c4c0d"></a>

<a id="orgfd40de7"></a>

And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken. And immediately all the doors were opened and the bands of all were loosed.


<a id="orge81d9d3"></a>

## Acts 16:27

And the keeper of the prison, awakening out of his sleep and seeing the doors of the prison open, drawing his sword, would have killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had been fled.

And he, taking them the same hour of the night, washed their stripes: and himself was baptized, and all his house immediately.


<a id="org3683064"></a>

And when he had brought them into his own house, he laid the table for them: and rejoiced with all his house, believing God.


<a id="org9932616"></a>

And when the day was come, the magistrates sent the serjeants, saying: Let those men go.


<a id="orge566d35"></a>

## Acts 16:36

And the keeper of the prison told these words to Paul: The magistrates have sent to let you go. Now therefore depart. And go in peace.


<a id="org2061c92"></a>

## Acts 16:37

But Paul said to them: They have beaten us publicly, uncondemned, men that are Romans, and have cast us into prison. And now do they thrust us out privately? Not so: but let them come.


<a id="orga48d5a8"></a>

## Acts 16:38

And let us out themselves. And the serjeants told these words to the magistrates. And they were afraid: hearing that they were Romans.

<a id="orgae94ff4"></a>

## Acts 17:1

And when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews.


<a id="org62da0a6"></a>

## Acts 17:2

And Paul, according to his custom, went in unto them. And for three sabbath days he reasoned with them out of the scriptures:


<a id="org772e952"></a>

## Acts 17:3

Declaring and insinuating that the Christ was to suffer and to rise again from the dead; and that this is Jesus Christ, whom I preach to you.


<a id="org7ad9b92"></a>

## Acts 17:4

And some of them believed and were associated to Paul and Silas: and of those that served God and of the Gentiles a great multitude: and of noble women not a few.


<a id="org51efc1a"></a>

## Acts 17:5

But the Jews, moved with envy and taking unto them some wicked men of the vulgar sort and making a tumult, set the city in an uproar: and besetting Jason&rsquo;s house, sought to bring them out unto the people.


<a id="orgd0bf6ed"></a>

## Acts 17:6

And not finding them, they drew Jason and certain brethren to the rulers of the city, crying: They that set the city in an uproar are come hither also:


<a id="org55b06fa"></a>

## Acts 17:7

Whom Jason hath received. And these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, Jesus.


<a id="org61a2923"></a>

## Acts 17:8

And they stirred up the people: and the rulers of the city, hearing these things,


<a id="org48ca848"></a>

## Acts 17:9

And having taken satisfaction of Jason and of the rest, they let them go.


<a id="org5720c97"></a>

## Acts 17:10

But the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Berea. Who, when they were come thither, went into the synagogue of the Jews.


<a id="orga2b8446"></a>

## Acts 17:11

Now these were more noble than those in Thessalonica, who received the word with all eagerness, daily searching the scriptures, whether these things were so.


<a id="org1ea59c4"></a>

## Acts 17:12

And many indeed of them believed: and of honourable women that were Gentiles and of men, not a few.


<a id="org5c8eec9"></a>

## Acts 17:13

And when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was also preached by Paul at Berea, they came thither also, stirring up and troubling the multitude.


<a id="org8c2f1af"></a>

## Acts 17:14

And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul, to go unto the sea: but Silas and Timothy remained there.


<a id="orge716e68"></a>

## Acts 17:15

And they that conducted Paul brought him as far as Athens: and receiving a commandment from him to Silas and Timothy, that they should come to him with all speed, they departed.


<a id="orgcbbb4da"></a>

## Acts 17:16

Now whilst Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred within him, seeing the city wholly given to idolatry.


<a id="org5863740"></a>

## Acts 17:17

He disputed, therefore, in the synagogue with the Jews and with them that served God: and in the market place, every day, with them that were there.


<a id="org76bc460"></a>

## Acts 17:18

And certain philosophers of the Epicureans and of the Stoics disputed with him. And some said: What is it that this word sower would say? But others: He seemeth to be a setter forth of new gods. Because he preached to them Jesus and the resurrection.


<a id="org6c3410e"></a>

## Acts 17:19

And taking him, they brought him to the Areopagus, saying: May we know what this new doctrine is, which thou speakest of?


<a id="orgf0110af"></a>

## Acts 17:20

For thou bringest in certain new things to our ears. We would know therefore what these things mean.


<a id="org13a729d"></a>

## Acts 17:21

(Now all the Athenians and strangers that were there employed themselves in nothing else, but either in telling or in hearing some new thing.)


<a id="orgdff497b"></a>

## Acts 17:22

But Paul, standing in the midst of the Areopagus, said: Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things you are too superstitious.


<a id="org2f9f046"></a>

## Acts 17:23

For passing by and seeing your idols, I found an altar also, on which was written: To the Unknown God. What therefore you worship without knowing it, that I preach to you:


<a id="org98c4beb"></a>

## Acts 17:24

God, who made the world and all things therein, he being Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands.


<a id="org935c890"></a>

## Acts 17:25

Neither is he served with men&rsquo;s hands, as though he needed any thing: seeing it is he who giveth to all life and breath and all things:


<a id="orgc229e82"></a>

## Acts 17:26

And hath made of one, all mankind, to dwell upon the whole face of the earth, determining appointed times and the limits of their habitation.


<a id="org2aa4a06"></a>

## Acts 17:27

That they should seek God, if haply they may feel after him or find him, although he be not far from every one of us.


<a id="orgb5595a4"></a>

## Acts 17:28

For in him we live and move and are: as some also of your own poets said: For we are also his offspring.


<a id="org6cddef2"></a>

## Acts 17:29

Being therefore the offspring of God, we must not suppose the divinity to be like unto gold or silver or stone, the graving of art and device of man.


<a id="org84552ee"></a>

## Acts 17:30

And God indeed having winked at the times of this ignorance, now declareth unto men that all should every where do penance.


<a id="orgc73791e"></a>

## Acts 17:31

Because he hath appointed a day wherein he will judge the world in equity, by the man whom he hath appointed: giving faith to all, by raising him up from the dead.


<a id="orgf326fb5"></a>

## Acts 17:32

And when they had heard of the resurrection of the dead, some indeed mocked. But others said: We will hear thee again concerning this matter.


<a id="org344f489"></a>

## Acts 17:33

So Paul went out from among them.


<a id="org42b25c9"></a>

## Acts 17:34

But certain men, adhering to him, did believe: among whom was also Dionysius the Areopagite and a woman named Damaris and others with them. 


<a id="org6b0f678"></a>

# Acts 18


<a id="orgbdc8fb8"></a>

## Acts 18:1

After these things, departing from Athens, he came to Corinth.


<a id="org92df69a"></a>

## Acts 18:2

And finding a certain Jew, named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with Priscilla his wife (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome), he came to them.


<a id="org93e0321"></a>

## Acts 18:3

And because he was of the same trade, he remained with them and wrought. (Now they were tentmakers by trade.)


<a id="orgf4502cb"></a>

## Acts 18:4

And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, bringing in the name of the Lord Jesus. And he persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.


<a id="org0b97ada"></a>

## Acts 18:5

And when Silas and Timothy were come from Macedonia, Paul was earnest in preaching, testifying to the Jews that Jesus is the Christ.


<a id="org575bba4"></a>

## Acts 18:6

But they gainsaying and blaspheming, he shook his garments and said to them: Your blood be upon your own heads: I am clean. From henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles.


<a id="orgd830ff4"></a>

## Acts 18:7

And departing thence, he entered into the house of a certain man, named Titus Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house was adjoining to the synagogue.


<a id="org9b19b1b"></a>

## Acts 18:8

And Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord, with all his house. And many of the Corinthians hearing, believed and were baptized.


<a id="orgceb594e"></a>

## Acts 18:9

And the Lord said to Paul in the night, by a vision: Do not fear, but speak. And hold not thy peace,


<a id="orgbe614e6"></a>

## Acts 18:10

Because I am with thee and no man shall set upon thee, to hurt thee. For I have much people in this city.


<a id="org0d4b5f3"></a>

## Acts 18:11

And he stayed there a year and six months, teaching among them the word of God.


<a id="org85d0b63"></a>

## Acts 18:12

But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one accord rose up against Paul and brought him to the judgment seat,


<a id="org546bcf6"></a>

## Acts 18:13

Saying: This man persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law.


<a id="org855e228"></a>

## Acts 18:14

And when Paul was beginning to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews: If it were some matter of injustice or an heinous deed, O Jews, I should with reason bear with you.


<a id="org0abb757"></a>

## Acts 18:15

But if they be questions of word and names and of your law, look you to it. I will not be judge of such things.


<a id="org2084fc9"></a>

## Acts 18:16

And he drove them from the judgment seat.


<a id="orgb01128c"></a>

## Acts 18:17

And all laying hold on Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, beat him before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for none of those things.


<a id="org98cb56b"></a>

## Acts 18:18

But Paul, when he had stayed yet many days, taking his leave of the brethren, sailed thence into Syria (and with him Priscilla and Aquila), having shorn his head in Cenchrae. For he had a vow.


<a id="orgb9631a5"></a>

## Acts 18:19

And he came to Ephesus and left them there. But he himself, entering into the synagogue, disputed with the Jews.


<a id="org0bf5e67"></a>

## Acts 18:20

And when they desired him that he would tarry a longer time, he consented not:


<a id="org852e936"></a>

## Acts 18:21

But taking his leave and saying: I will return to you again, God willing, he departed from Ephesus.


<a id="org6662178"></a>

## Acts 18:22

And going down to Caesarea, he went up to Jerusalem and saluted the church: and so came down to Antioch.


<a id="org4ff8f1f"></a>

## Acts 18:23

And after he had spent some time there, he departed and went through the country of Galatia and Phrygia, in order, confirming all the disciples.


<a id="org8609b72"></a>

## Acts 18:24

Now a certain Jew, named Apollo, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, came to Ephesus, one mighty in the scriptures.


<a id="org2841f0a"></a>

## Acts 18:25

This man was instructed in the way of the Lord: and being fervent in spirit, spoke and taught diligently the things that are of Jesus, knowing only the baptism of John.


<a id="orgd4e148e"></a>

## Acts 18:26

This man therefore began to speak boldly in the synagogue. Whom when Priscilla and Aquila had heard, they took him to them and expounded to him the way of the Lord more diligently.


<a id="orgdc677d8"></a>

## Acts 18:27

And whereas he was desirous to go to Achaia, the brethren exhorting wrote to the disciples to receive him. Who, when he was come, helped them much who had believed.


<a id="orgcc1db97"></a>

## Acts 18:28

For with much vigour he convinced the Jews openly, shewing by the scriptures that Jesus is the Christ. 


<a id="org6a5228a"></a>

# Acts 19


<a id="org8ae13fa"></a>

## Acts 19:1

And it came to pass, while Apollo was at Corinth, that Paul, having passed through the upper coasts, came to Ephesus and found certain disciples.


<a id="orgf10ae63"></a>

## Acts 19:2

And he said to them: Have you received the Holy Ghost since ye believed? But they said to him: We have not so much as heard whether there be a Holy Ghost.


<a id="orgbc81aed"></a>

## Acts 19:3

And he said: In what then were you baptized? Who said: In John&rsquo;s baptism.


<a id="orgba8cd32"></a>

## Acts 19:4

Then Paul said: John baptized the people with the baptism of penance saying: That they should believe in him, who was to come after him, that is to say, in Jesus.


<a id="orgc7c7ad8"></a>

## Acts 19:5

Having heard these things, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.


<a id="orgf2412be"></a>

<a id="orga85781a"></a>

And entering into the synagogue, he spoke boldly for the space of three months, disputing and exhorting concerning the kingdom of God.


<a id="org9055fc5"></a>

## Acts 19:9

But when some were hardened and believed not, speaking evil of the way of the Lord before the multitude, departing from them, he separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.


<a id="org5196338"></a>

## Acts 19:10

And this continued for the space of two years, so that all who dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Gentiles.


<a id="orgd168f08"></a>

## Acts 19:11

And God wrought by the hand of Paul more than common miracles.


<a id="org322b987"></a>

## Acts 19:12

So that even there were brought from his body to the sick, handkerchiefs and aprons: and the diseases departed from them: and the wicked spirits went out of them.


<a id="orgfcd50a5"></a>

## Acts 19:13

Now some also of the Jewish exorcists, who went about, attempted to invoke over them that had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying: I conjure you by Jesus, whom Paul preacheth.


<a id="org4d7ade4"></a>

## Acts 19:14

And there were certain men, seven sons of Sceva, a Jew, a chief priest, that did this.


<a id="org524ef66"></a>

## Acts 19:15

But the wicked spirit, answering, said to them: Jesus I know: and Paul I know. But who are you?


<a id="org7ab2ed9"></a>

## Acts 19:16

And the man in whom the wicked spirit was, leaping upon them and mastering them both, prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.


<a id="org2d81d2d"></a>

## Acts 19:17

And this became known to all the Jews and the Gentiles that dwelt a Ephesus. And fear fell on them all: and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.

## Acts 19:18

And many of them that believed came, confessing and declaring their deeds


<a id="org484ed2c"></a>

## Acts 19:19

## Acts 19:20

So mightily grew the word of God and was confirmed.


<a id="orga5f8a51"></a>

## Acts 19:21

<a id="orgca296fb"></a>

## Acts 19:22

And sending into Macedonia two of them that ministered to him, Timothy and Erastus, he himself remained for a time in Asia.

## Acts 19:23

Now at that time there arose no small disturbance about the way of the Lord.


<a id="orge45d4bb"></a>

## Acts 19:24

For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver temples for Diana, brought no small gain to the craftsmen.


<a id="orge97978e"></a>

## Acts 19:25

Whom he calling together with the workmen of like occupation, said: Sirs, you know that our gain is by this trade.


<a id="orgefaa55a"></a>

## Acts 19:26

And you see and hear that this Paul, by persuasion hath drawn away a great multitude, not only of Ephesus, but almost of all Asia, saying: they are not gods which are made by hands.


<a id="orgb7e8277"></a>

## Acts 19:27

So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought, but also the temple of great Diana shall be reputed for nothing! Yea, and her majesty shall begin to be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worshippeth.


<a id="org1e7a20f"></a>

## Acts 19:28

Having heard these things, they were full of anger and cried out, saying: Great is Diana of the Ephesians!


<a id="org1185f10"></a>

## Acts 19:29

And the whole city was filled with confusion. And having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul&rsquo;s companions, they rushed with one accord into the theatre.

## Acts 19:30

And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not.


<a id="org477fef7"></a>

And some also of the rulers of Asia, who were his friends, sent unto him, desiring that he would not venture himself into the theatre.


<a id="org6c3920d"></a>

Now some cried one thing, some another. For the assembly was confused: and the greater part knew not for what cause they were come together.


<a id="orgacce8ce"></a>

And they drew forth Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews thrusting him forward. And Alexander, beckoning with his hand for silence, would have given the people satisfaction,


<a id="org8d547af"></a>

But as soon as they perceived him to be a Jew, all with one voice, for the space of about two, hours, cried out: Great is Diana of the Ephesians!


<a id="org7283dad"></a>

## Acts 19:35

And when the town clerk had appeased the multitudes, he said: Ye men of Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not that the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great Diana and of Jupiter&rsquo;s offspring?


<a id="org459744f"></a>

## Acts 19:36

For as much therefore as these things cannot be contradicted, you ought to be quiet and to do nothing rashly.


<a id="org330b997"></a>

## Acts 19:37

For you have brought hither these men, who are neither guilty of sacrilege nor of blasphemy against your goddess.


<a id="org4306ba5"></a>

## Acts 19:38

But if Demetrius and the craftsmen that are with him have a matter against any man, the courts of justice are open: and there are proconsuls. Let them accuse one another.

## Acts 19:39

And if you inquire after any other matter, it may be decided in a lawful assembly.


<a id="orgb8bf5b3"></a>

## Acts 19:40

For we are even in danger to be called in question for this day&rsquo;s uproar, there being no man guilty (of whom we may give account) of this concourse. And when he had said these things, he dismissed the assembly.

And when he was come to the stairs, it fell out that he was carried by the soldiers, because of the violence of the people.

For the multitude of the people followed after, crying: Away with him!


<a id="org6fb402f"></a>

## Acts 21:40

And when he had given him leave, Paul standing on the stairs, beckoned with his hand to the people. And a great silence being made, he spoke unto them in the Hebrew tongue, saying:

# Acts 22


<a id="org2856f1f"></a>

## Acts 22:1

Men, brethren and fathers, hear ye the account which I now give unto you.


<a id="orgb31ec1a"></a>

## Acts 22:2

(And when they heard that he spoke to them in the Hebrew tongue, they kept the more silence.)


<a id="org60ee7b3"></a>

## Acts 22:3

And he saith: I am a Jew, born at Tarsus in Cilicia, but brought up in this city, at the feet of Gamaliel, taught according to the truth of the law of the fathers, zealous for the law, as also all you are this day:


<a id="org9320c1d"></a>

## Acts 22:4

Who persecuted this way unto death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women,


<a id="org601b090"></a>

## Acts 22:5

As the high priest doth bear me witness and all the ancients. From whom also receiving letters to the brethren, I went to Damascus, that I might bring them bound from thence to Jerusalem to be punished.


<a id="orgfc0a2df"></a>

## Acts 22:6

And it came to pass, as I was going and drawing nigh to Damascus, at mid-day, that suddenly from heaven there shone round about me a great light:


<a id="orgec0d6d4"></a>

## Acts 22:7

And falling on the ground, I heard a voice saying to me: Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?


<a id="orgf401aeb"></a>

## Acts 22:8

And I answered: Who art thou, Lord? And he said to me: I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.


<a id="org0016986"></a>

## Acts 22:9

And they that were with me saw indeed the light: but they heard not the voice of him that spoke with me.


<a id="orga13f31c"></a>

## Acts 22:10

And I said: What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said to me: Arise and go to Damascus; and there it shall be told thee of all things that thou must do.


<a id="orgf692975"></a>

## Acts 22:11

And whereas I did not see for the brightness of that light, being led by the hand by my companions, I came to Damascus,


<a id="org0158b6d"></a>

## Acts 22:12

And one Ananias, a man according to the law, having testimony of all the Jews who dwelt there,


<a id="orge6eb8f6"></a>

## Acts 22:13

Coming to me and standing by me, said to me: Brother Saul, look up. And I, the same hour, looked upon him.


<a id="org01593e7"></a>

## Acts 22:14

But he said: The God of our fathers hath preordained thee that thou shouldst know his will and see the Just One and shouldst hear the voice from his mouth.


<a id="org66eb767"></a>

## Acts 22:15

For thou shalt be his witness to all men of those things which thou hast seen and heard.


<a id="org9367457"></a>

## Acts 22:16

And now why tarriest thou? Rise up and be baptized and wash away thy sins, invoking his name.


<a id="org45b191b"></a>

## Acts 22:17

And it came to pass, when I was come again to Jerusalem and was praying in the temple, that I was in a trance,


<a id="org08136bb"></a>

## Acts 22:18

And saw him saying unto me: Make haste and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem: because they will not receive thy testimony concerning me.


<a id="org6b92fd2"></a>

## Acts 22:19

And I said: Lord, they know that I cast into prison and beat in every synagogue them that believed in thee.


<a id="orgaf306b4"></a>

## Acts 22:20

And when the blood of Stephen thy witness was shed, I stood by and consented: and kept the garments of them that killed him.


<a id="org7710181"></a>

## Acts 22:21

And he said to me: Go, for unto the Gentiles afar off will I send thee.


<a id="org4d05140"></a>

## Acts 22:22

And they heard him until this word and then lifted up their voice, saying: Away with such an one from the earth. For it is not fit that he should live.


<a id="org83cb9f5"></a>

## Acts 22:23

And as they cried out and threw off their garments and cast dust into the air,


<a id="org9a7ca44"></a>

## Acts 22:24

The tribune commanded him to be brought into the castle, and that he should be scourged and tortured: to know for what cause they did so cry out against him.


<a id="org3911c9b"></a>

## Acts 22:25

And when they had bound him with thongs, Paul saith to the centurion that stood by him: Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman and uncondemned?


<a id="org17cd37d"></a>

## Acts 22:26

Which the centurion hearing, went to the tribune and told him, saying: What art thou about to do? For this man is a Roman citizen.


<a id="orge7b34d4"></a>

## Acts 22:27

And the tribune coming, said to him: Tell me. Art thou a Roman? But he said: Yea.


<a id="orgdd0c2c1"></a>

## Acts 22:28

And the tribune answered: I obtained the being free of this city with a great sum. And Paul said: But I was born so.


<a id="org2b533f8"></a>

## Acts 22:29

Immediately therefore they departed from him that were about to torture him. The tribune also was afraid after he understood that he was a Roman citizen and because he had bound him.


<a id="org9e4e1b7"></a>

## Acts 22:30

But on the next day, meaning to know more diligently for what cause he was accused by the Jews, he loosed him and commanded the priests to come together and all the council: and, bringing forth Paul, he set him before them. 


<a id="org360acb4"></a>

# Acts 23


<a id="org2826a6d"></a>

## Acts 23:1

And Paul, looking upon the council, said: Men, brethren, I have conversed with all good conscience before God until this present day.


<a id="org249fc22"></a>

## Acts 23:2

And the high priest, Ananias, commanded them that stood by him to strike him on the mouth.


<a id="orgc5f711a"></a>

## Acts 23:3

Then Paul said to him: God shall strike thee, thou whited wall. For, sittest thou to judge me according to the law and, contrary to the law, commandest me to be struck?


<a id="orga76866c"></a>

## Acts 23:4

And they that stood by said: Dost thou revile the high priest of God?


<a id="org0cf5914"></a>

## Acts 23:5

And Paul said: I knew not, brethren, that he is the high priest. For it is written: Thou shalt not speak evil of the prince of thy people.


<a id="org73b6d0d"></a>

## Acts 23:6

And Paul, knowing that the one part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, cried out in the council: Men, brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of Pharisees: concerning the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question.


<a id="org6114a0a"></a>

## Acts 23:7

And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees. And the multitude was divided.


<a id="orgfafd1a6"></a>

## Acts 23:8

For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess both.


<a id="org7e37fb8"></a>

## Acts 23:9

And there arose a great cry. And some of the Pharisees rising up, strove, saying: We find no evil in this man. What if a spirit hath spoken to him, or an angel?


<a id="org92a6893"></a>

## Acts 23:10

And when there arose a great dissension, the tribune, fearing lest Paul should be pulled in pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down and to take him by force from among them and to bring him into the castle.


<a id="org46310d7"></a>

## Acts 23:11

And the night following, the Lord standing by him, said: Be constant: for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome.


<a id="orge48f4c4"></a>

## Acts 23:12

And when day was come, some of the Jews gathered together and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they killed Paul.


<a id="org8bfebc6"></a>

## Acts 23:13

And they were more than forty men that had made this conspiracy.


<a id="orgd570432"></a>

## Acts 23:14

Who came to the chief priests and the ancients and said: We have bound ourselves under a great curse that we will eat nothing till we have slain Paul.


<a id="org14469b6"></a>

## Acts 23:15

Now therefore do you with the council signify to the tribune, that he bring him forth to you, as if you meant to know something more certain touching him. And we, before he come near, are ready to kill him.


<a id="org1fc4451"></a>

## Acts 23:16

Which when Paul&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s son had heard, of their lying in wait, he came and entered into the castle and told Paul.


<a id="orgeb17620"></a>

## Acts 23:17

And Paul, calling to him one of the centurions, said: Bring this young man to the tribune: for he hath some thing to tell him.


<a id="org4de75d8"></a>

## Acts 23:18

And he, taking him, brought him to the tribune and said: Paul, the prisoner, desired me to bring this young man unto thee, who hath some thing to say to thee.


<a id="orga9c7223"></a>

## Acts 23:19

And the tribune, taking him by the hand, went aside with him privately and asked him: What is it that thou hast to tell me?


<a id="org8e8fb89"></a>

## Acts 23:20

And he said: The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldst bring forth Paul to-morrow into the council, as if they meant to inquire some thing more certain touching him.


<a id="org57e2287"></a>

## Acts 23:21

But do not thou give credit to them: for there lie in wait for him more than forty men of them, who have bound themselves by oath neither to eat nor to drink, till they have killed him. And they are now ready, looking for a promise from thee.


<a id="orgcef7db9"></a>

## Acts 23:22

The tribune therefore dismissed the young man, charging him that he should tell no man that he had made known these things unto him.


<a id="orge0a246e"></a>

## Acts 23:23

Then having called two centurions, he said to them: Make ready two hundred soldiers to go as far as Caesarea: and seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen, for the third hour of the night.


<a id="org0fb68ca"></a>

## Acts 23:24

And provide beasts, that they may set Paul on and bring him safe to Felix the governor.


<a id="orgbc9ef75"></a>

## Acts 23:25

(For he feared lest perhaps the Jews might take him away by force and kill him: and he should afterwards be slandered, as if he was to take money.) And he wrote a letter after this manner:


<a id="org48ca86a"></a>

## Acts 23:26

Claudius Lysias to the most excellent governor, Felix, greeting:


<a id="org4dbfd55"></a>

## Acts 23:27

This man, being taken by the Jews and ready to be killed by them, I rescued, coming in with an army, understanding that he is a Roman.


<a id="org6e9fc1a"></a>

## Acts 23:28

And meaning to know the cause which they objected unto him, I brought him forth into their council.


<a id="org592ac0a"></a>

## Acts 23:29

Whom I found to be accused concerning questions of their law; but having nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bands.


<a id="org7012c25"></a>

## Acts 23:30

And when I was told of ambushes that they had prepared for him, I sent him to thee, signifying also to his accusers to plead before thee. Farewell.


<a id="orge84dee1"></a>

## Acts 23:31

Then the soldiers, according as it was commanded them, taking Paul, brought him by night to Antipatris.


<a id="org198cd06"></a>

## Acts 23:32

And the next day, leaving the horsemen to go with him, they returned to the castle.


<a id="orgc9241fc"></a>

## Acts 23:33

Who, when they were come to Caesarea and had delivered the letter to the governor, did also present Paul before him.


<a id="orgf187618"></a>

## Acts 23:34

And when he had read it and had asked of what province he was and understood that he was of Cilicia:


<a id="org5d19618"></a>

## Acts 23:35

I will hear thee, said he, when thy accusers come. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod&rsquo;s judgment hall. 


<a id="org885f92e"></a>

# Acts 24


<a id="org845000a"></a>

## Acts 24:1

And after five days, the high priest, Ananias, came down with some ancients and one Tertullus, an orator, who went to the governor against Paul.


<a id="org63d7b3d"></a>

## Acts 24:2

And Paul being called for, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying: Whereas, through thee we live in much peace and many things are rectified by thy providence,


<a id="org039da00"></a>

## Acts 24:3

We accept it always and in all places, most excellent Felix, with all thanksgiving.


<a id="org73f8d2b"></a>

## Acts 24:4

But that I be no further tedious to thee, I desire thee of thy clemency to hear us in a few words.


<a id="org18e3238"></a>

## Acts 24:5

We have found this to be a pestilent man and raising seditions among all the Jews throughout the world: and author of the sedition of the sect of the Nazarenes.


<a id="org3c809ba"></a>

## Acts 24:6

Who also hath gone about to profane the temple: whom, we having apprehended, would also have judged according to our law.


<a id="org1c88235"></a>

## Acts 24:7

But Lysias the tribune, coming upon us with great violence, took him away out of our hands;


<a id="org2d88ecc"></a>

## Acts 24:8

Commanding his accusers to come to thee. Of whom thou mayest thyself, by examination, have knowledge of all these things whereof we accuse him.


<a id="org35fadb0"></a>

## Acts 24:9

And the Jews also added and said that these things were so.


<a id="org7bf30ec"></a>

## Acts 24:10

Then Paul answered (the governor making a sign to him to speak): Knowing that for many years thou hast been judge over this nation, I will with good courage answer for myself.


<a id="orgc4e89b5"></a>

## Acts 24:11

For thou mayest understand that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to adore in Jerusalem:


<a id="org2666d77"></a>

## Acts 24:12

And neither in the temple did they find me disputing with any man or causing any concourse of the people: neither in the synagogues, nor in the city.


<a id="org397550a"></a>

## Acts 24:13

Neither can they prove unto thee the things whereof they now accuse me.


<a id="org9d50e9c"></a>

## Acts 24:14

But this I confess to thee that according to the way which they call a heresy, so do I serve the Father and my God, believing all things which are written in the law and the prophets:


<a id="org04e7d1d"></a>

## Acts 24:15

Having hope in God, which these also themselves look for, that there shall be a resurrection of the just and unjust.


<a id="org5a450f7"></a>

## Acts 24:16

And herein do I endeavour to have always a conscience without offence, towards God and towards men.


<a id="org9c909e5"></a>

## Acts 24:17

Now after many years, I came to bring alms to my nation and offerings and vows.


<a id="orgdda5b2a"></a>

## Acts 24:18

In which I was found purified in the temple: neither with multitude nor with tumult.


<a id="org9250a96"></a>

## Acts 24:19

But certain Jews of Asia, who ought to be present before thee and to accuse, if they had anything against me:


<a id="org3909570"></a>

## Acts 24:20

Or let these men themselves say if they found in me any iniquity, when standing before the council,


<a id="org7b86f0e"></a>

## Acts 24:21

Except it be for this one voice only that I cried, standing among them: Concerning the resurrection of the dead am I judged this day by you.


<a id="orgeca363b"></a>

## Acts 24:22

And Felix put them off, having most certain knowledge of this way, saying: When Lysias the tribune shall come down, I will hear you.


<a id="org2ead49e"></a>

## Acts 24:23

And he commanded a centurion to keep him: and that he should be easy and that he should not prohibit any of his friends to minister unto him.


<a id="orgcf9c176"></a>

## Acts 24:24

And after some days, Felix, coming with Drusilla his wife, who was a Jew, sent for Paul and heard of him the faith that is in Christ Jesus.


<a id="orge9607bb"></a>

## Acts 24:25

And as he treated of justice and chastity and of the judgment to come, Felix, being terrified, answered: For this time, go thy way: but when I have a convenient time, I will send for thee.


<a id="orgacf5bf6"></a>

## Acts 24:26

Hoping also withal that money should be given him by Paul: for which cause also oftentimes sending for him, he spoke with him.


<a id="org5922f4f"></a>

## Acts 24:27

But when two years were ended, Felix had for successor Portius Festus. And Felix being willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound. 


<a id="org54fb911"></a>

# Acts 25


<a id="orge1d3829"></a>

## Acts 25:1

Now when Festus was come into the province, after three days, he went up to Jerusalem from Cesarea.


<a id="orgaa171d7"></a>

## Acts 25:2

And the chief priests and principal men of the Jews went unto him against Paul: and they besought him,


<a id="org443181a"></a>

## Acts 25:3

Requesting favour against him, that he would command him to be brought to Jerusalem, laying wait to kill him in the way.


<a id="orgaf4a67d"></a>

## Acts 25:4

But Festus answered: That Paul was kept in Caesarea: and that he himself would very shortly depart thither.


<a id="orga558f80"></a>

## Acts 25:5

Let them, therefore, saith he, among you that are able, go down with me and accuse him, if there be any crime in the man.


<a id="org4d495d0"></a>

## Acts 25:6

And having tarried among them no more than eight or ten days, he went down to Caesarea. And the next day, he sat in the judgment seat and commanded Paul to be brought.


<a id="org5ebb1ff"></a>

## Acts 25:7

Who being brought, the Jews stood about him, who were come down from Jerusalem, objecting many and grievious causes, which they could not prove:


<a id="org6b9bc94"></a>

## Acts 25:8

Paul making answer for himself: Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar, have I offended in any thing.


<a id="orgbbee384"></a>

## Acts 25:9

But Festus, willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, answering Paul, said: Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem and there be judged of these things before me?


<a id="org0a66b54"></a>

## Acts 25:10

Then Paul said: I stand at Caesar&rsquo;s judgment seat, where I ought to be judged. To the Jews I have done no injury, as thou very well knowest.


<a id="org3f30241"></a>

## Acts 25:11

For if I have injured them or have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die. But if there be none of these things whereof they accuse me, no man may deliver me to them. I appeal to Caesar.


<a id="orge86550b"></a>

## Acts 25:12

Then Festus, having conferred with the council, answered: Hast thou appealed to Caesar? To Caesar shalt thou go.


<a id="org2fbb86c"></a>

## Acts 25:13

And after some days, king Agrippa and Bernice came down to Caesarea, to salute Festus.


<a id="org92f81fd"></a>

## Acts 25:14

And as they tarried there many days, Festus told the king of Paul, saying: A certain man was left prisoner by Felix.


<a id="org772857d"></a>

## Acts 25:15

About whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the ancients of the Jews came unto me, desiring condemnation against him.


<a id="org98f7d21"></a>

## Acts 25:16

To whom I answered: it is not the custom of the Romans to condemn any man, before that he who is accused have his accusers present and have liberty to make his answer, to clear himself of the things laid to his charge.


<a id="org5af0bbd"></a>

## Acts 25:17

When therefore they were come hither, without any delay, on the day following, sitting in the judgment seat, I commanded the man to be brought.


<a id="org1227280"></a>

## Acts 25:18

Against whom, when the accusers stood up, they brought no accusation of this which I thought ill of:


<a id="orgf2f48db"></a>

## Acts 25:19

But had certain questions of their own superstition against him, and of one Jesus deceased, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.


<a id="org4a641f3"></a>

## Acts 25:20

I therefore being in a doubt of this manner of question, asked him whether he would go to Jerusalem and there be judged of these things.


<a id="org9056657"></a>

## Acts 25:21

But Paul, appealing to be reserved unto the hearing of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept, till I might send him to Caesar.


<a id="orgaa177c6"></a>

## Acts 25:22

And Agrippa said to Festus: I would also hear the man, myself. To-morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him.


<a id="org49ca807"></a>

## Acts 25:23

And on the next day, when Agrippa and Bernice were come with great pomp and had entered into the hall of audience with the tribunes and principal men of the city, at Festus&rsquo; commandment, Paul was brought forth.


<a id="orgd453347"></a>

## Acts 25:24

And Festus saith: King Agrippa and all ye men who are here present with us, you see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews dealt with me at Jerusalem, requesting and crying out that he ought not to live any longer.


<a id="orgb9fb94a"></a>

## Acts 25:25

Yet have I found nothing that he hath committed worthy of death. But forasmuch as he himself hath appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him.


<a id="orge08179b"></a>

## Acts 25:26

Of whom I have nothing certain to write to my lord. For which cause, I have brought him forth before you, and especially before thee, O king Agrippa, that, examination being made, I may have what to write.


<a id="orge29cb90"></a>

## Acts 25:27

For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner and not to signify the things laid to his charge. 


<a id="org15627ca"></a>

# Acts 26


<a id="org1c66968"></a>

## Acts 26:1

Then Agrippa said to Paul: Thou art permitted to speak for thyself. Then Paul, stretching forth his hand, began to make his answer.


<a id="orgc33cb2e"></a>

## Acts 26:2

I think myself happy, O king Agrippa, that I am to answer for myself this day before thee, touching all the things whereof I am accused by the Jews.


<a id="org989c3bd"></a>

## Acts 26:3

Especially as thou knowest all, both customs and questions, that are among the Jews. Wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.


<a id="org8f89e1f"></a>

## Acts 26:4

And my life indeed from my youth, which was from the beginning among my own nation in Jerusalem, all the Jews do know:


<a id="org2f660eb"></a>

## Acts 26:5

Having known me from the beginning (if they will give testimony) that according to the most sure sect of our religion I lived, a Pharisee.


<a id="org698aa1c"></a>

## Acts 26:6

And now for the hope of the promise that was made by God to the fathers, do I stand subject to judgment:


<a id="org3a94120"></a>

## Acts 26:7

Unto which, our twelve tribes, serving night and day, hope to come. For which hope, O king, I am accused by the Jews.


<a id="orgd03a6cf"></a>

## Acts 26:8

Why should it be thought a thing incredible that God should raise the dead?


<a id="org597685e"></a>

## Acts 26:9

And I indeed did formerly think that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.


<a id="org0de5a10"></a>

## Acts 26:10

Which also I did at Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority of the chief priests. And when they were put to death, I brought the sentence.


<a id="orge582379"></a>

## Acts 26:11

And oftentimes punishing them, in every synagogue, I compelled them to blaspheme: and being yet more mad against them, I persecuted them even unto foreign cities.


<a id="org3e628e8"></a>

## Acts 26:12

Whereupon, when I was going to Damascus with authority and permission of the chief priest,


<a id="orgaa26ea7"></a>

## Acts 26:13

At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them that were in company with me.


<a id="orgde8121d"></a>

## Acts 26:14

And when we were all fallen down on the ground, I heard a voice speaking to me in the Hebrew tongue: Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? It is hard for thee to kick against the good.


<a id="orge70f34e"></a>

## Acts 26:15

And I said: Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord answered: I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.


<a id="org405429f"></a>

## Acts 26:16

But rise up and stand upon thy feet: for to this end have I appeared to thee, that I may make thee a minister and a witness of those things which thou hast seen and of those things wherein I will appear to thee,


<a id="org8529c7c"></a>

## Acts 26:17

Delivering thee from the people and from the nations unto which now I send thee:


<a id="orgb5a03cb"></a>

## Acts 26:18

To open their eyes, that they may be converted from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a lot among the saints, by the faith that is in me.


<a id="org5f9de5e"></a>

## Acts 26:19

Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not incredulous to the heavenly vision.


<a id="orga5f0647"></a>

## Acts 26:20

But to them first that are at Damascus and at Jerusalem, and unto all the country of Judea, and to the Gentiles did I preach, that they should do penance and turn to God, doing works worthy of penance.


<a id="org88d07b1"></a>

## Acts 26:21

For this cause, the Jews, when I was in the temple, having apprehended me, went about to kill me.


<a id="orged068e8"></a>

## Acts 26:22

But being aided by the help of God, I stand unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying no other thing than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come to pass:


<a id="org3381373"></a>

## Acts 26:23

That Christ should suffer and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead and should shew light to the people and to the Gentiles.


<a id="org7d4e3a1"></a>

## Acts 26:24

As he spoke these things and made his answer, Festus said with a loud voice: Paul, thou art beside thyself: much learning doth make thee mad.


<a id="org177b180"></a>

## Acts 26:25

And Paul said: I am not mad, most excellent Festus, but I speak words of truth and soberness.


<a id="org9d2b709"></a>

## Acts 26:26

For the king knoweth of these things, to whom also I speak with confidence. For I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him. For neither was any of these things done in a corner.


<a id="orge2ec88e"></a>

## Acts 26:27

Believest thou the prophets, O king Agrippa? I know that thou believest.


<a id="orgf0d0fd4"></a>

## Acts 26:28

And Agrippa said to Paul: In a little thou persuadest me to become a Christian.


<a id="orgfee3176"></a>

## Acts 26:29

And Paul said: I would to God that both in a little and in much, not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, should become such as I also am, except these bands.


<a id="org547a5d0"></a>

## Acts 26:30

And the king rose up, and the governor and Bernice and they that sat with them.


<a id="org217afd3"></a>

## Acts 26:31

And when they were gone aside, they spoke among themselves, saying: This man hath done nothing worthy of death or of bands.


<a id="org6c8463a"></a>

## Acts 26:32

And Agrippa said to Festus: This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed to Caesar. 


<a id="org0f49e78"></a>

# Acts 27


<a id="org75b531c"></a>

## Acts 27:1

And when it was determined that he should sail into Italy and that Paul, with the other prisoners, should be delivered to a centurion, named Julius, of the band Augusta,


<a id="org0f47ef9"></a>

## Acts 27:2

Going on board a ship of Adrumetum, we launched, meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia, Aristarchus, the Macedonian of Thessalonica, continuing with us.


<a id="orgfa76b9a"></a>

## Acts 27:3

And the day following, we came to Sidon. And Julius, treating Paul courteously, permitted him to go to his friends and to take care of himself.


<a id="org43f4fab"></a>

## Acts 27:4

And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.


<a id="org0f30b3b"></a>

## Acts 27:5

And sailing over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Lystra, which is in Lycia.


<a id="orgb06cce3"></a>

## Acts 27:6

And there, the centurion, finding a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy, removed us into it.


<a id="org952d93a"></a>

## Acts 27:7

And when for many days we had sailed slowly and were scarce come over against Gnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed near Crete by Salmone.


<a id="org531fe59"></a>

## Acts 27:8

And with much ado sailing by it, we came into a certain place, which is called Good-havens, nigh to which was the city of Thalassa.


<a id="org8e30c9d"></a>

## Acts 27:9

And when much time was spent and when sailing now was dangerous, because the fast was now past, Paul comforted them,


<a id="org9175eb7"></a>

## Acts 27:10

Saying to them: Ye men, I see that the voyage beginneth to be with injury and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives.


<a id="org8aea0bf"></a>

## Acts 27:11

But the centurion believed the pilot and the master of the ship, more than those things which were said by Paul.


<a id="org4d51302"></a>

## Acts 27:12

And whereas it was not a commodious haven to winter in, the greatest part gave counsel to sail thence, if by any means they might reach Phenice, to winter there, which is a haven of Crete, looking towards the southwest and northwest.


<a id="orge7efada"></a>

## Acts 27:13

And the south wind gently blowing, thinking that they had obtained their purpose, when they had loosed from Asson, they sailed close by Crete.


<a id="org765e983"></a>

## Acts 27:14

But not long after, there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroaquilo.


<a id="org062df6d"></a>

## Acts 27:15

And when the ship was caught and could not bear up against the wind, giving up the ship to the winds, we were driven.


<a id="org6a0434d"></a>

## Acts 27:16

And running under a certain island that is called Cauda, we had much work to come by the boat.


<a id="orgbcfc2f1"></a>

## Acts 27:17

Which being taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship: and fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands, they let down the sail yard and so were driven.


<a id="orgc3c6dc7"></a>

## Acts 27:18

And we, being mightily tossed with the tempest, the next day they lightened the ship.


<a id="org645b93e"></a>

## Acts 27:19

And the third day they cast out with their own hands the tacking of the ship.


<a id="orgbe4221b"></a>

## Acts 27:20

And when neither sun nor stars appeared for many days and no small storms lay on us, all hope of our being saved was now taken away.


<a id="org17b5045"></a>

## Acts 27:21

And after they had fasted a long time, Paul standing forth in the midst of them, said: You should indeed, O ye men, have hearkened unto me and not have loosed from Crete and have gained this harm and loss.


<a id="org497458d"></a>

## Acts 27:22

And now I exhort you to be of good cheer. For there shall be no loss of any man&rsquo;s life among you, but only of the ship.


<a id="org5b5ddd0"></a>

## Acts 27:23

For an angel of God, whose I am and whom I serve, stood by me this night,


<a id="org9ceb9f0"></a>

## Acts 27:24

Saying: Fear not, Paul, thou must be brought before Caesar; and behold, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee.


<a id="orgbb852cf"></a>

## Acts 27:25

Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall so be, as it hath been told me.


<a id="org6bb68f4"></a>

## Acts 27:26

And we must come unto a certain island.


<a id="org3cb2690"></a>

## Acts 27:27

But after the fourteenth night was come, as we were sailing in Adria, about midnight, the shipmen deemed that they discovered some country.


<a id="org7bcbc75"></a>

## Acts 27:28

Who also sounding, found twenty fathoms: and going on a little further, they found fifteen fathoms.


<a id="orgb00e06e"></a>

## Acts 27:29

Then fearing lest we should fall upon rough places, they cast four anchors out of the stern: and wished for the day.


<a id="orgd6778ea"></a>

## Acts 27:30

But as the shipmen sought to fly out of the ship, having let down the boat into the sea, under colour, as though they would have cast anchors out of the forepart of the ship,


<a id="org06929f3"></a>

## Acts 27:31

Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers: Except these stay in the ship, you cannot be saved.


<a id="org39ea020"></a>

## Acts 27:32

Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat and let her fall off.


<a id="orgff176cf"></a>

## Acts 27:33

And when it began to be light, Paul besought them all to take meat, saying: This day is the fourteenth day that you have waited and continued fasting, taking nothing.


<a id="org6a79bd8"></a>

## Acts 27:34

Wherefore, I pray you to take some meat for your health&rsquo;s sake: for there shall not an hair of the head of any of you perish.


<a id="orgc44830f"></a>

## Acts 27:35

And when he had said these things, taking bread, he gave thanks to God in the sight of them all. And when he had broken it, he began to eat.


<a id="orge3da7f4"></a>

## Acts 27:36

Then were they all of better cheer: and they also took some meat.


<a id="orgcf48973"></a>

## Acts 27:37

And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls.


<a id="org720fa96"></a>

## Acts 27:38

And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, casting the wheat into the sea.


<a id="org828c380"></a>

## Acts 27:39

And when it was day, they knew not the land. But they discovered a certain creek that had a shore, into which they minded, if they could, to thrust in the ship.


<a id="org77ce585"></a>

## Acts 27:40

And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed themselves to the sea, loosing withal the rudder bands. And hoisting up the mainsail to the wind, they made towards shore.


<a id="org9f61785"></a>

## Acts 27:41

And when we were fallen into a place where two seas met, they run the ship aground. And the forepart indeed, sticking fast, remained unmoveable: but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the sea.


<a id="org70682a0"></a>

## Acts 27:42

And the soldiers&rsquo; counsel was that they should kill the prisoners, lest any of them, swimming out should escape.


<a id="orgb8ccf6f"></a>

## Acts 27:43

But the centurion, willing to save Paul, forbade it to be done. And he commanded that they who could swim should cast themselves first into the sea and save themselves and get to land.


<a id="orga0e106b"></a>

## Acts 27:44

And the rest, some they carried on boards and some on those things that belonged to the ship. And so it came to pass that every soul got safe to land. 


<a id="orgdd93578"></a>

# Acts 28


<a id="orgd2fdac5"></a>

## Acts 28:1

And when we had escaped, then we knew that the island was called Melita. But the barbarians shewed us no small courtesy.


<a id="orgbe00e1b"></a>

## Acts 28:2

For kindling a fire, they refreshed us all, because of the present rain and of the cold.


<a id="org909667a"></a>

## Acts 28:3

And when Paul had gathered together a bundle of sticks and had laid them on the fire, a viper, coming out of the heat, fastened on his hand.


<a id="org22cd4c1"></a>

## Acts 28:4

And when the barbarians saw the beast hanging on his hand, they said one to another: Undoubtedly this man is a murderer, who, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance doth not suffer him to live.


<a id="org503f0a5"></a>

## Acts 28:5

And he indeed, shaking off the beast into the fire, suffered no harm.


<a id="org2d21292"></a>

## Acts 28:6

But they supposed that he would begin to swell up and that he would suddenly fall down and die. But expecting long and seeing that there came no harm to him, changing their minds, they said that he was a god.


<a id="org7de238e"></a>

## Acts 28:7

Now in these places were possessions of the chief man of the island, named Publius: who, receiving us for three days, entertained us courteously.


<a id="org64ffa33"></a>

## Acts 28:8

And it happened that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux. To whom Paul entered in. And when he had prayed and laid his hands on him, he healed him.


<a id="orgf69578c"></a>

## Acts 28:9

Which being done, all that had diseases in the island came and were healed.


<a id="org3c468fa"></a>

## Acts 28:10

Who also honoured us with many honours: and when we were to set sail, they laded us with such things as were necessary.


<a id="org2f77eca"></a>

## Acts 28:11

And after three months, we sailed in a ship of Alexandria, that had wintered in the island, whose sign was the Castors.


<a id="org657f176"></a>

## Acts 28:12

And when we were come to Syracusa, we tarried there three days.


<a id="org3f13d01"></a>

## Acts 28:13

From thence, compassing by the shore, we came to Rhegium: and after one day, the south wind blowing, we came the second day to Puteoli:


<a id="org6c792be"></a>

## Acts 28:14

Where, finding brethren, we were desired to tarry with them seven days. And so we went to Rome.


<a id="orgc450fc6"></a>

## Acts 28:15

And from thence, when the brethren had heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii Forum and the Three Taverns. Whom when Paul saw, he gave thanks to God and took courage.


<a id="org9ae1e38"></a>

## Acts 28:16

And when we were come to Rome, Paul was suffered to dwell by himself, with a soldier that kept him.


<a id="org447af36"></a>

## Acts 28:17

And after the third day, he called together the chief of the Jews. And when they were assembled, he said to them: Men, brethren, I, having done nothing against the people or the custom of our fathers, was delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.


<a id="org2f61977"></a>

## Acts 28:18

Who, when they had examined me, would have released me, for that there was no cause of death in me.


<a id="org255013a"></a>

## Acts 28:19

But the Jews contradicting it, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar: not that I had anything to accuse my nation of.
