As the lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters.


<a id="org43c2f05"></a>

My dove in the clefts of the rock, in the hollow places of the wall, shew me thy face, let thy voice sound in my ears: for thy voice is sweet, and thy face comely.

Catch us the little foxes that destroy the vines: for our vineyard hath flourished.

My beloved to me, and I to him who feedeth among the lilies,

## Song of Solomon 5:1

Let my beloved come into his garden, and eat the fruit of his apple trees. I am come into my garden, O my sister, my spouse, I have gathered my myrrh, with my aromatical spices: I have eaten the honeycomb with my honey, I have drunk my wine with my milk: eat, O friends, and drink, and be inebriated, my dearly beloved.


<a id="org1cf9a11"></a>

## Song of Solomon 5:2

I sleep, and my heart watcheth: the voice of my beloved knocking: Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is full of dew, and my locks of the drops of the nights.


<a id="org3b5b512"></a>

My beloved is white and ruddy, chosen out of thousands.


<a id="orgc1f7874"></a>

Thy teeth as a flock of sheep, which come up from the washing, all with twins, and there is none barren among them.
