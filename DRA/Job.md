# Job 1


<a id="org0455161"></a>

## Job 1:1

There was a man in the land of Hus, whose name was Job, and that man was simple and upright, and fearing God, and avoiding evil.


<a id="org01baae7"></a>

## Job 1:2

And there were born to him seven sons and three daughters.


<a id="orga12c0eb"></a>

## Job 1:3

And his possession was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a family exceedingly great: and this man was great among all the people of the east.


<a id="org86dd586"></a>

## Job 1:4

And his sons went, and made a feast by houses, every one in his day. And sending, they called their three sisters, to eat and drink with them.


<a id="orgafb9f77"></a>

## Job 1:5

And when the days of their feasting were gone about, Job sent to them, and sanctified them: and rising up early, offered holocausts for every one of them. For he said: Lest perhaps my sons have sinned, and have blessed God in their hearts. So did Job all days.


<a id="orgcc1b4c8"></a>

## Job 1:6

Now on a certain day, when the sons of God came to stand before the Lord, Satan also was present among them.


<a id="org0bfffff"></a>

## Job 1:7

And the Lord said to him: Whence comest thou? And he answered and said: I have gone round about the earth, and walked through it.


<a id="org9cf876e"></a>

## Job 1:8

And the Lord said to him: Hast thou considered my servant, Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a simple and upright man, and fearing God, and avoiding evil?


<a id="org5095c8a"></a>

## Job 1:9

And Satan answering, said: Doth Job fear God in vain?


<a id="org738bbec"></a>

## Job 1:10

Hast thou not made a fence for him, and his house, and all his substance round about, blessed the works of his hands, and his possession hath increased on the earth?


<a id="org6bb4eea"></a>

## Job 1:11

But stretch forth thy hand a little, and touch all that he hath, and see if he bless thee not to thy face.


<a id="orgb85ca8b"></a>

## Job 1:12

Then the Lord said to Satan: Behold, all that he hath is in thy hand: only put not forth thy hand upon his person. And Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord.


<a id="orgaef2589"></a>

## Job 1:13

Now upon a certain day, when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine, in the house of their eldest brother,


<a id="org68f954c"></a>

## Job 1:14

There came a messenger to Job, and said: The oxen were ploughing, and the asses feeding beside them,


<a id="org00f510c"></a>

## Job 1:15

And the Sabeans rushed in, and took all away, and slew the servants with the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell thee.


<a id="orgc3f6a10"></a>

## Job 1:16

And while he was yet speaking, another came, and said: The fire of God fell from heaven, and striking the sheep and the servants, hath consumed them; and I alone have escaped to tell thee.


<a id="orgc2b6880"></a>

## Job 1:17

And while he also was yet speaking, there came another, and said: The Chaldeans made three troops, and have fallen upon the camels, and taken them; moreover, they have slain the servants with the sword: and I alone have escaped to tell thee.


<a id="org18b3dd1"></a>

## Job 1:18

He was yet speaking, and behold another came in, and said: Thy sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their eldest brother,


<a id="org50df3e8"></a>

## Job 1:19

A violent wind came on a sudden from the side of the desert, and shook the four corners of the house, and it fell upon thy children, and they are dead: and I alone have escaped to tell thee.


<a id="org04f3ecf"></a>

## Job 1:20

Then Job rose up, and rent his garments, and having shaven his head, fell down upon the ground, and worshipped,


<a id="org92ea55a"></a>

## Job 1:21

And said: Naked came I out of my mother&rsquo;s womb, and naked shall I return thither: the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away: as it hath pleased the Lord, so is it done: blessed be the name of the Lord.


<a id="org4123d68"></a>

## Job 1:22

In all these things Job sinned not by his lips, nor spoke he any foolish thing against God. 


<a id="org41915ec"></a>

# Job 2


<a id="org6e45f7f"></a>

## Job 2:1

And it came to pass, when on a certain day the sons of God came, and stood before the Lord, and Satan came amongst them, and stood in his sight,


<a id="orgb32f2b6"></a>

## Job 2:2

That the Lord said to Satan: Whence comest thou? And he answered, and said: I have gone round about the earth, and walked through it.


<a id="org9e75e1c"></a>

## Job 2:3

And the Lord said to Satan: Hast thou considered my servant, Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a man simple and upright, and fearing God, and avoiding evil, and still keeping his innocence? But thou hast moved me against him, that I should afflict him without cause.


<a id="orgdfb52a3"></a>

## Job 2:4

And Satan answered, and said: Skin for skin; and all that a man hath, he will give for his life:


<a id="orgdb3a460"></a>

## Job 2:5

But put forth thy hand, and touch his bone and his flesh, and then thou shalt see that he will bless thee to thy face.


<a id="orgaa4228b"></a>

## Job 2:6

And the Lord said to Satan: Behold, he is in thy hand, but yet save his life.


<a id="org7b18945"></a>

## Job 2:7

So Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord, and struck Job with a very grievous ulcer, from the sole of the foot even to the top of his head:


<a id="org779366f"></a>

## Job 2:8

And he took a potsherd and scraped the corrupt matter, sitting on a dunghill.


<a id="orgad4d060"></a>

## Job 2:9

And his wife said to him: Dost thou still continue in thy simplicity? bless God and die.


<a id="org494a51f"></a>

## Job 2:10

And he said to her: Thou hast spoken like one of the foolish women: If we have received good things at the hand of God, why should we not receive evil? In all these things Job did not sin with his lips.


<a id="org9f6de06"></a>

## Job 2:11

Now when Job&rsquo;s three friends heard all the evil that had befallen him, they came every one from his own place, Eliphaz, the Themanite, and Baldad, the Suhite, and Sophar, the Naamathite. For they had made an appointment to come together and visit him, and comfort him.


<a id="org25a8a1f"></a>

## Job 2:12

And when they had lifted up their eyes afar off, they knew him not, and crying out, they wept, and rending their garments, they sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.


<a id="org00f71c0"></a>

## Job 2:13

And they sat with him on the ground seven day and seven nights and no man spoke to him a word: for they saw that his grief was very great. 


<a id="org668f6f5"></a>

# Job 3


<a id="orgc72a629"></a>

## Job 3:1

After this, Job opened his mouth, and cursed his day,


<a id="org2e55a57"></a>

## Job 3:2

And he said:


<a id="org4348a71"></a>

## Job 3:3

Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was said: A man child is conceived.


<a id="orgd114ec7"></a>

## Job 3:4

Let that day be turned into darkness, let not God regard it from above, and let not the light shine upon it.


<a id="orgf63f1fc"></a>

## Job 3:5

Let darkness, and the shadow of death, cover it, let a mist overspread it, and let it be wrapped up in bitterness.


<a id="orga7fcc21"></a>

## Job 3:6

Let a darksome whirlwind seize upon that night, let it not be counted in the days of the year, nor numbered in the months.


<a id="org1719abb"></a>

## Job 3:7

Let that night be solitary, and not worthy of praise.


<a id="org800c5e8"></a>

## Job 3:8

Let them curse it who curse the day, who are ready to raise up a leviathan:


<a id="orgf1d262f"></a>

## Job 3:9

Let the stars be darkened with the mist thereof: let it expect light, and not see it, nor the rising of the dawning of the day:


<a id="org6038d21"></a>

## Job 3:10

Because it shut not up the doors of the womb that bore me, nor took away evils from my eyes.


<a id="org67bdf6e"></a>

## Job 3:11

Why did I not die in the womb? why did I not perish when I came out of the belly?


<a id="org656ce6a"></a>

## Job 3:12

Why received upon the knees? why suckled at the breasts?


<a id="org427e935"></a>

## Job 3:13

For now I should have been asleep and still, and should have rest in my sleep:


<a id="orgc01e008"></a>

## Job 3:14

With kings and consuls of the earth, who build themselves solitudes:


<a id="orgebfab4f"></a>

## Job 3:15

Or with princes, that possess gold, and fill their houses with silver:


<a id="org8049034"></a>

## Job 3:16

Or as a hidden untimely birth, I should not be; or as they that, being conceived, have not seen the light.


<a id="org67ca39e"></a>

## Job 3:17

There the wicked cease from tumult, and there the wearied in strength are at rest.


<a id="org91ca65d"></a>

## Job 3:18

And they sometime bound together without disquiet, have not heard the voice of the oppressor.


<a id="org6acd5be"></a>

## Job 3:19

The small and great are there, and the servant is free from his master.


<a id="orgbd99636"></a>

## Job 3:20

Why is light given to him that is in misery, and life to them that are in bitterness of soul?


<a id="orgc4007db"></a>

## Job 3:21

That look for death, and it cometh not, as they that dig for a treasure:


<a id="org521519e"></a>

## Job 3:22

And they rejoice exceedingly when they have found the grave?


<a id="orgd722cd8"></a>

## Job 3:23

To a man whose way is hidden, and God hath surrounded him with darkness?


<a id="org2fe6092"></a>

## Job 3:24

Before I eat I sigh: and as overflowing waters, so is my roaring:


<a id="org8ca5a2c"></a>

## Job 3:25

For the fear which I feared, hath come upon me: and that which I was afraid of, hath befallen me.


<a id="org989d8cf"></a>

## Job 3:26

Have I not dissembled? have I not kept silence? have I not been quiet? and indignation is come upon me. 


<a id="orgd8ee487"></a>

# Job 4


<a id="org7cb034e"></a>

## Job 4:1

Then Eliphaz, the Themanite, answered, and said:


<a id="orgb59ab04"></a>

## Job 4:2

If we begin to speak to thee, perhaps thou wilt take it ill; but who can withhold the words he hath conceived?


<a id="org58cb149"></a>

## Job 4:3

Behold thou hast taught many, and thou hast strengthened the weary hands:


<a id="org3d05abe"></a>

## Job 4:4

Thy words have confirmed them that were staggering, and thou hast strengthened the trembling knees:


<a id="org014fdaf"></a>

## Job 4:5

But now the scourge is come upon thee, and thou faintest: It hath touched thee, and thou art troubled.


<a id="org730cb62"></a>

## Job 4:6

Where is thy fear, thy fortitude, thy patience, and the perfection of thy ways?


<a id="orgb659748"></a>

## Job 4:7

Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished being innocent? or when were the just destroyed?


<a id="org515c383"></a>

## Job 4:8

On the contrary, I have seen those who work iniquity, and sow sorrows, and reap them,


<a id="org4d871e2"></a>

## Job 4:9

Perishing by the blast of God, and consumed by the spirit of his wrath.


<a id="org82dc1dc"></a>

## Job 4:10

The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the lioness, and the teeth of the whelps of lions, are broken:


<a id="orgd5c369f"></a>

## Job 4:11

The tiger hath perished for want of prey, and the young lions are scattered abroad.


<a id="orgd2ef0bd"></a>

## Job 4:12

Now there was a word spoken to me in private, and my ears by stealth, as it were, received the veins of its whisper.


<a id="orgbb494df"></a>

## Job 4:13

In the horror of a vision by night, when deep sleep is wont to hold men,


<a id="org53a94d4"></a>

## Job 4:14

Fear seized upon me, and trembling, and all my bones were affrighted:


<a id="orgfba4de4"></a>

## Job 4:15

And when a spirit passed before me, the hair of my flesh stood up.


<a id="org1abf4c1"></a>

## Job 4:16

There stood one whose countenance I knew not, an image before my eyes, and I heard the voice, as it were, of a gentle wind.


<a id="orgea6305f"></a>

## Job 4:17

Shall man be justified in comparison of God, or shall a man be more pure than his maker?


<a id="orgc1b66d8"></a>

## Job 4:18

Behold, they that serve him are not steadfast, and in his angels he found wickedness:


<a id="org79e5384"></a>

## Job 4:19

How much more shall they that dwell in houses of clay, who have an earthly foundation, be consumed as with the moth?


<a id="orgec562fb"></a>

## Job 4:20

From morning till evening they shall be cut down: and because no one understandeth, they shall perish for ever.


<a id="org0425820"></a>

## Job 4:21

And they that shall be left, shall be taken away from them: they shall die, and not in wisdom. 


<a id="orgef6778b"></a>

# Job 5


<a id="org08a8f21"></a>

## Job 5:1

Call now, if there be any that will answer thee, and turn to some of the saints.


<a id="orgcb5f9a3"></a>

## Job 5:2

Anger indeed killeth the foolish, and envy slayeth the little one.


<a id="org972a743"></a>

## Job 5:3

I have seen a fool with a strong root, and I cursed his beauty immediately.


<a id="orgc087450"></a>

His children shall be far from safety, and shall be destroyed in the gate, and there shall be none to deliver them.


<a id="org3163050"></a>

Whose harvest the hungry shall eat, and the armed man shall take him by violence, and the thirsty shall drink up his riches.


<a id="org0b473c5"></a>

Nothing upon earth is done without a cause, and sorrow doth not spring out of the ground.


<a id="orga1f9b53"></a>

## Job 5:7

Man is born to labour, and the bird to fly.


<a id="orgc691220"></a>

## Job 5:8

Wherefore I will pray to the Lord, and address my speech to God:

## Job 5:9

Who doth great things, and unsearchable and wonderful things without number:

## Job 5:10

Who giveth rain upon the face of the earth, and watereth all things with waters:

Who setteth up the humble on high, and comforteth with health those that mourn.


<a id="org198e916"></a>

Who bringeth to nought the designs of the malignant, so that their hands cannot accomplish what they had begun:

They shall meet with darkness in the day, and grope at noonday as in the night.


<a id="org813578f"></a>

But he shall save the needy from the sword of their mouth, and the poor from the hand of the violent.

And to the needy there shall be hope, but iniquity shall draw in her mouth.

Blessed is the man whom God correcteth: refuse not, therefore, the chastising of the Lord.

For he woundeth, and cureth: he striketh, and his hands shall heal.

<a id="org6aeb526"></a>

## Job 6:1

But Job answered, and said:


<a id="org3d60fd3"></a>

O that my sins, whereby I have deserved wrath, and the calamity that I suffer, were weighed in a balance.


<a id="org6260885"></a>

## Job 6:3

As the sand of the sea, this would appear heavier: therefore, my words are full of sorrow:


<a id="org34a95c3"></a>

For the arrows of the Lord are in me, the rage whereof drinketh up my spirit, and the terrors of the Lord war against me.


<a id="org0693612"></a>

The things which before my soul would not touch, now, through anguish, are my meats.

## Job 6:8

Who will grant that my request may come: and that God may give me what I look for?


<a id="org67acd8c"></a>

## Job 6:9

And that he that hath begun may destroy me, that he may let loose his hand, and cut me off?


<a id="org81f5bdd"></a>

## Job 6:10

And that this may be my comfort, that afflicting me with sorrow, he spare not, nor I contradict the words of the Holy one.


<a id="orga98585b"></a>

## Job 6:11

For what is my strength, that I can hold out? or what is my end, that I should keep patience?

My strength is not the strength of stones, nor is my flesh of brass.

## Job 6:21

Now you are come: and now, seeing my affliction, you are afraid.

# Job 7


<a id="org43aba95"></a>

## Job 7:1

The life of man upon earth is a warfare, and his days are like the days of a hireling.


<a id="orge71ce68"></a>

## Job 7:2

As a servant longeth for the shade, as the hireling looketh for the end of his work;

Nor shall he return any more into his house, neither shall his place know him any more


<a id="orgf8a3a20"></a>

Wherefore, I will not spare my mouth, I will speak in the affliction of my spirit: I will talk with the bitterness of my soul.


<a id="orgb0302b9"></a>

## Job 7:12

Am I a sea, or a whale, that thou hast enclosed me in a prison?


<a id="orgd9a2388"></a>

## Job 7:13

If I say: My bed shall comfort me, and I shall be relieved, speaking with myself on my couch:


<a id="org1922816"></a>

## Job 7:14

Thou wilt frighten me with dreams, and terrify me with visions.


<a id="orge53d182"></a>

## Job 7:15

So that my soul rather chooseth hanging, and my bones death.

I have done with hope, I shall now live no longer: spare me, for my days are nothing.


<a id="org82cbda7"></a>

What is a man, that thou shouldst magnify him or why dost thou set thy heart upon him?

Thou visitest him early in the morning, and thou provest him suddenly.


<a id="orgf329268"></a>

## Job 7:19

How long wilt thou not spare me, nor suffer me to swallow down my spittle?


<a id="org72b5692"></a>

## Job 7:20

I have sinned: what shall I do to thee, O keeper of men? why hast thou set me opposite to thee. and am I become burdensome to myself?


<a id="orga7c0967"></a>

## Job 7:21

Why dost thou not remove my sin, and why dost thou not take away my iniquity? Behold now I shall sleep in the dust: and if thou seek me in the morning, I shall not be.

# Job 8


<a id="org40784d2"></a>

## Job 8:1

Then Baldad, the Suhite, answered, and said:


<a id="org504d49e"></a>

## Job 8:2

How long wilt thou speak these things, and how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind?


<a id="org8b9447a"></a>

## Job 8:3

Doth God pervert judgment, or doth the Almighty overthrow that which is just?


<a id="org4ac0a5b"></a>

## Job 8:4

Although thy children have sinned against him, and he hath left them in the hand of their iniquity:


<a id="orgf03b146"></a>

## Job 8:5

Yet if thou wilt arise early to God, and wilt beseech the Almighty:


<a id="org8ff900b"></a>

## Job 8:6

If thou wilt walk clean and upright, he will presently awake unto thee, and will make the dwelling of thy justice peaceable:


<a id="orgc5a5742"></a>

## Job 8:7

In so much, that if thy former things were small thy latter things would be multiplied exceedingly.


<a id="org599e709"></a>

## Job 8:8

For inquire of the former generation, and search diligently into the memory of the fathers:


<a id="org1264b23"></a>

## Job 8:9

(For we are but of yesterday, and are ignorant that our days upon earth are but a shadow)


<a id="orgda284d7"></a>

## Job 8:10

And they shall teach thee: they shall speak to thee, and utter words out of their hearts.


<a id="org83b23ed"></a>

## Job 8:11

Can the rush be green without moisture? or sedge bush grow without water?


<a id="org6a16fa6"></a>

## Job 8:12

When it is yet in flower, and is not plucked up with the hand, it withereth before all herbs.


<a id="org95f1384"></a>

## Job 8:13

Even so are the ways of all that forget God, and the hope of the hypocrite shall perish:


<a id="org4ba097f"></a>

## Job 8:14

His folly shall not please him, and his trust shall be like the spider&rsquo;s web.


<a id="org91da047"></a>

## Job 8:15

He shall lean upon his house, and it shall not stand: he shall prop it up, and it shall not rise:


<a id="orgbc18fe8"></a>

He seemeth to have moisture before the sun cometh; and at his rising, his blossom shall shoot forth.


<a id="org97c4c87"></a>

For this is the joy of his way, that others may spring again out of the earth.


<a id="orge595996"></a>

## Job 8:20

God will not cast away the simple, nor reach out his hand to the evil doer:

## Job 8:21

Until thy mouth be filled with laughter, and thy lips with rejoicing.


<a id="org64fbd28"></a>

## Job 8:22

# Job 9


<a id="org794a836"></a>

## Job 9:1

And Job answered, and said:


<a id="orgc770c89"></a>

## Job 9:2

Indeed I know it is so, and that man cannot be justified, compared with God.


<a id="orgcd51819"></a>

## Job 9:3

If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one for a thousand.


<a id="orgb5ed3b2"></a>

## Job 9:4

He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath resisted him, and hath had peace?


<a id="orgd48b336"></a>

## Job 9:5

Who hath removed mountains, and they whom he overthrew in his wrath, knew it not.


<a id="org6ea6039"></a>

## Job 9:6

Who shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble.


<a id="orga20b1fb"></a>

## Job 9:7

Who commandeth the sun, and it riseth not: and shutteth up the stars, as it were, under a seal:


<a id="org0ea742d"></a>

## Job 9:8

Who alone spreadeth out the heavens, and walketh upon the waves of the sea.


<a id="org8197c00"></a>

## Job 9:9

Who maketh Arcturus, and Orion, and Hyades, and the inner parts of the south.


<a id="orgda5eeb4"></a>

## Job 9:10

Who doth things great and incomprehensible, and wonderful, of which there is no number.


<a id="orge0a1903"></a>

## Job 9:11

If he come to me, I shall not see him: if he depart, I shall not understand.


<a id="org4c3e41f"></a>

## Job 9:12

If he examine on a sudden, who shall answer him? or who can say: Why dost thou so?


<a id="orgd56a64d"></a>

## Job 9:13

God, whose wrath no man can resist, and under whom they stoop that bear up the world.


<a id="org2972e75"></a>

## Job 9:14

What am I then, that I should answer him, and have words with him?


<a id="org56a090c"></a>

## Job 9:15

I, who although I should have any just thing, would not answer, but would make supplication to my judge.


<a id="org457d122"></a>

## Job 9:16

And if he should hear me when I call, I should not believe that he had heard my voice.


<a id="orga299e20"></a>

## Job 9:17

For he shall crush me in a whirlwind, and multiply my wounds even without cause.


<a id="org712c3a4"></a>

## Job 9:18

He alloweth not my spirit to rest, and he filleth me with bitterness.


<a id="orgf8894a9"></a>

## Job 9:19

If strength be demanded, he is most strong: if equity of judgment, no man dare bear witness for me.


<a id="orgd22617f"></a>

## Job 9:20

If I would justify myself, my own mouth shall condemn me: if I would shew myself innocent, he shall prove me wicked.


<a id="org37f770e"></a>

## Job 9:21

Although I should be simple, even this my soul shall be ignorant of, and I shall be weary of my life.


<a id="orgf8e371c"></a>

## Job 9:22

One thing there is that I have spoken, both the innocent and the wicked he consumeth.


<a id="orge3b0132"></a>

## Job 9:23

If he scourge, let him kill at once, and not laugh at the pains of the innocent.


<a id="org6d4d369"></a>

## Job 9:24

The earth is given into the hand of the wicked, he covereth the face of the judges thereof: and if it be not he, who is it then?


<a id="org38772d7"></a>

## Job 9:25

My days have been swifter than a post: they have fled away and have not seen good.


<a id="orga25ea6c"></a>

## Job 9:26

They have passed by as ships carrying fruits, as an eagle flying to the prey.


<a id="orgce98874"></a>

## Job 9:27

If I say: I will not speak so: I change my face, and am tormented with sorrow.


<a id="org4d49e59"></a>

## Job 9:28

I feared all my works, knowing that thou didst not spare the offender.


<a id="orgef9d08d"></a>

## Job 9:29

But if so also I am wicked, why have I laboured in vain?


<a id="org4081962"></a>

## Job 9:30

If I be washed, as it were, with snow waters, and my hands shall shine ever so clean:


<a id="org079bd94"></a>

## Job 9:31

Yet thou shalt plunge me in filth, and my garments shall abhor me.


<a id="orge396a8a"></a>

## Job 9:32

For I shall not answer a man that is like myself: nor one that may be heard with me equally in judgment.


<a id="org98aaa35"></a>

## Job 9:33

There is none that may be able to reprove both, and to put his hand between both.


<a id="org006d3f9"></a>

## Job 9:34

Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrify me.


<a id="orgb569f26"></a>

## Job 9:35

I will speak, and will not fear him: for I cannot answer while I am in fear.

# Job 10


<a id="orgc713eb6"></a>

## Job 10:1

My soul is weary of my life, I will let go my speech against myself, I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.


<a id="org484c74f"></a>

## Job 10:2

I will say to God: Do not condemn me: tell me why thou judgest me so?


<a id="orga6c3454"></a>

## Job 10:3

Doth it seem good to thee that thou shouldst calumniate me, and oppress me, the work of thy own hands, and help the counsel of the wicked?

## Job 10:4

Hast thou eyes of flesh: or, shalt thou see as man seeth?

## Job 10:5

Are thy days as the days of man, and are thy years as the times of men:


<a id="orgb699856"></a>

## Job 10:6

That thou shouldst inquire after my iniquity, and search after my sin?


<a id="org86068dd"></a>

## Job 10:7

And shouldst know that I have done no wicked thing, whereas there is no man that can deliver out of thy hand?


<a id="orgfb90a62"></a>

## Job 10:8

Thy hands have made me, and fashioned me wholly round about, and dost thou thus cast me down headlong on a sudden?

## Job 10:9

Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay, and thou wilt bring me into dust


<a id="org1f6c0ce"></a>

Hast thou not milked me as milk, and curdled me like cheese?


<a id="org32c5e4a"></a>

## Job 10:11

Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh: thou hast put me together with bones and sinews:

## Job 10:12

Thou hast granted me life and mercy, and thy visitation hath preserved my spirit.


<a id="orgf5ed739"></a>

## Job 10:13

Although thou conceal these things in thy heart, yet I know that thou rememberest all things.


<a id="org78021c8"></a>

If I have sinned, and thou hast spared me for an hour: why dost thou not suffer me to be clean from my iniquity?

And if I be wicked, woe unto me: and if just, I shall not lift up my head, being filled with affliction and misery.


<a id="orgbcd5c21"></a>

## Job 10:16

And for pride thou wilt take me as a lioness, and returning, thou tormentest me wonderfully.


<a id="org7a27358"></a>

## Job 10:17

Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and multipliest thy wrath upon me, and pains war against me.


<a id="orge3c64c7"></a>

## Job 10:18

Why didst thou bring me forth out of the womb? O that I had been consumed, that eye might not see me!


<a id="org11b1b70"></a>

## Job 10:19

I should have been as if I had not been, carried from the womb to the grave.


<a id="org09b648e"></a>

## Job 10:20

Shall not the fewness of my days be ended shortly? Suffer me, therefore, that I may lament my sorrow a little:

## Job 10:21

Before I go and return no more, to a land that is dark and covered with the mist of death:

A land of misery and darkness, where the shadow of death, and no order, but everlasting horror dwelleth.

## Job 11:1

Then Sophar the Naamathite answered, and said:

Shall not he that speaketh much, hear also? or shall a man full of talk be justified?

## Job 11:3

Shall men hold their peace to thee only? and when thou hast mocked others, shall no man confute thee?

And I wish that God would speak with thee, and would open his lips to thee,

The measure of him is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea.

## Job 11:10

If he shall overturn all things, or shall press them together, who shall contradict him?


<a id="org0db43eb"></a>

A vain man is lifted up into pride, and thinketh himself born free like a wild ass&rsquo;s colt.

If thou wilt put away from thee the iniquity that is in thy hand, and let not injustice remain in thy tabernacle:

## Job 32:6

Then Eliu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered, and said: I am younger in days, and you are more ancient, therefore hanging down my head, I was afraid to shew you my opinion.

## Job 32:7

For I hoped that greater age would speak, and that a multitude of years would teach wisdom.

## Job 32:8

But, as I see, there is a spirit in men, and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth understanding.


<a id="orgde2445f"></a>

## Job 32:9

They that are aged are not the wise men, neither do the ancients understand judgment.

And as long as I thought you said some thing, I considered: but, as I see, there is none of you that can convince Job, and answer his words.

Lest you should say: We have found wisdom, God hath cast him down, not man.

He hath spoken nothing to me, and I will not answer him according to your words.

## Job 32:15

They were afraid, and answered no more, and they left off speaking.


<a id="org07c7255"></a>

## Job 32:16

Therefore because I have waited, and they have not spoken: they stood, and answered no more:


<a id="orgad2b59e"></a>

## Job 32:17

I also will answer my part, and will shew my knowledge.


<a id="org55f5e3a"></a>

## Job 32:18

For I am full of matter to speak of, and the spirit of my bowels straiteneth me.

## Job 32:20

I will speak and take breath a little: I will open my lips, and will answer.

## Job 32:21

I will not accept the person of man, and I will not level God with man.

Because he hath found complaints against me, therefore he hath counted me for his enemy.

<a id="orga79dc00"></a>

Then he openeth the ears of men, and teaching instructeth them in what they are to learn.

That he may withdraw a man from the things he is doing, and may deliver him from pride.

He rebuketh also by sorrow in the bed, and he maketh all his bones to wither.


<a id="org1a5898d"></a>

## Job 33:21

His flesh shall be consumed away, and his bones that were covered shall be made bare.

<a id="org7a2b77f"></a>

## Job 34:1

And Eliu continued his discourse, and said:


<a id="org6192b5a"></a>

## Job 34:2

Hear ye, wise men, my words, and ye learned, hearken to me:


<a id="orgbfe42de"></a>

## Job 34:3

For the ear trieth words, and the mouth discerneth meats by the taste.


<a id="orgc3c878a"></a>

## Job 34:4

Let us choose to us judgment, and let us see among ourselves what is the best.


<a id="org60fc07e"></a>

## Job 34:5

For Job hath said: I am just, and God hath overthrown my judgment.


<a id="orgda7a477"></a>

## Job 34:6

For in judging me there is a lie: my arrow is violent without any sin.


<a id="org89d4d6d"></a>

## Job 34:7

What man is there like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water?


<a id="org4caf2e6"></a>

## Job 34:8

Who goeth in company with them that work iniquity, and walketh with wicked men?


<a id="org1c4a5b2"></a>

## Job 34:9

For he hath said: Man shall not please God, although he run with him.


<a id="orge3ab9a6"></a>

## Job 34:10

Therefore, ye men of understanding, hear me: far from God be wickedness, and iniquity from the Almighty.


<a id="org5ac58e4"></a>

## Job 34:11

For he will render to a man his work, and according to the ways of every one he will reward them.


<a id="orgae63db8"></a>

## Job 34:12

For in very deed God will not condemn without cause, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment.


<a id="org7dc13ca"></a>

## Job 34:13

What other hath he appointed over the earth? or whom hath he set over the world which he made?

## Job 34:14

If he turn his heart to him, he shall draw his spirit and breath unto himself.

## Job 34:15

All flesh shall perish together, and man shall return into ashes.


<a id="org2dfa477"></a>

## Job 34:16

If then thou hast understanding, hear what is said, and hearken to the voice of my words.


<a id="org7833ebd"></a>

## Job 34:17

Can he be healed that loveth not judgment? and how dost thou so far condemn him that is just?


<a id="org657ffcb"></a>

## Job 34:18

Who saith to the king: Thou art an apostate: who calleth rulers ungodly:


<a id="orgf055a0c"></a>

## Job 34:19

Who accepteth not the persons of princes: nor hath regarded the tyrant, when he contended against the poor man: for all are the work of his hands.


<a id="orgc2f0ae8"></a>

## Job 34:20

They shall suddenly die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and they shall pass, and take away the violent without hand.


<a id="org4f3eccb"></a>

## Job 34:21

For his eyes are upon the ways of men, and he considereth all their steps.


<a id="orgc9c1af8"></a>

## Job 34:22

There is no darkness, and there is no shadow of death, where they may be hid who work iniquity.


<a id="org75f9426"></a>

## Job 34:23

For it is no longer in the power of man to enter into judgment with God.


<a id="org153a535"></a>

## Job 34:24

He shall break in pieces many and innumerable, and shall make others to stand in their stead.


<a id="org771a51c"></a>

## Job 34:25

For he knoweth their works: and therefore he shall bring night on them, and they shall be destroyed.


<a id="org9fffbe4"></a>

## Job 34:26

He hath struck them, as being wicked, in open sight.


<a id="org9023dc6"></a>

## Job 34:27

Who as it were on purpose have revolted from him, and would not understand all his ways:


<a id="orga41d3c1"></a>

## Job 34:28

So that they caused the cry of the needy to come to him, and he heard the voice of the poor.


<a id="org9857397"></a>

## Job 34:29

For when he granteth peace, who is there that can condemn? When he hideth his countenance, who is there that can behold him, whether it regard nations, or all men?


<a id="org80d5f56"></a>

## Job 34:30

Who maketh a man that is a hypocrite to reign for the sins of the people.


<a id="orgb1a6781"></a>

## Job 34:31

Seeing then I have spoken of God, I will not hinder thee in thy turn.


<a id="orgad67659"></a>

## Job 34:32

If I have erred, teach thou me: if I have spoken iniquity, I will add no more.


<a id="org56dfd0c"></a>

## Job 34:33

Doth God require it of thee, because it hath displeased thee? for thou begannest to speak, and not I: but if thou know any thing better, speak.


<a id="org7ed82df"></a>

## Job 34:34

Let men of understanding speak to me, and let a wise man hearken to me.


<a id="orgb38ee52"></a>

## Job 34:35

But Job hath spoken foolishly, and his words sound not discipline.


<a id="orgfb21b3a"></a>

## Job 34:36

My father, let Job be tried even to the end: cease not from the man of iniquity.


<a id="org7e7537a"></a>

## Job 34:37

Because he addeth blasphemy upon his sins, let him be tied fast in the mean time amongst us: and then let him provoke God to judgment with his speeches. 


<a id="org311b14f"></a>

# Job 35


<a id="org0a15947"></a>

## Job 35:1

Moreover Eliu spoke these words:


<a id="org093b212"></a>

## Job 35:2

Doth thy thought seem right to thee, that thou shouldst say: I am more just than God?


<a id="org7fe302b"></a>

## Job 35:3

For thou saidst: That which is right doth not please thee: or what will it profit thee if I sin?


<a id="org0a7ad5a"></a>

## Job 35:4

Therefore I will answer thy words, and thy friends with thee.


<a id="org57065a0"></a>

## Job 35:5

Look up to heaven and see, and behold the sky, that it is higher than thee.


<a id="orgd86b773"></a>

## Job 35:6

If thou sin, what shalt thou hurt him? and if thy iniquities be multiplied, what shalt thou do against him?


<a id="org6147a9f"></a>

## Job 35:7

And if thou do justly, what shalt thou give him, or what shall he receive of thy hand?


<a id="orge8d0d7c"></a>

## Job 35:8

Thy wickedness may hurt a man that is like thee: and thy justice may help the son of man.


<a id="orge2ba265"></a>

## Job 35:9

By reason of the multitude of oppressors they shall cry out: and shall wail for the violence of the arm of tyrants.


<a id="org7e7f31b"></a>

## Job 35:10

And he hath not said: Where is God, who made me, who hath given songs in the night?


<a id="orge16bf63"></a>

## Job 35:11

Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and instructeth us more than the fowls of the air.


<a id="org8c05e5f"></a>

## Job 35:12

There shall they cry, and he will not hear, because of the pride of evil men.


<a id="org8e1e50c"></a>

## Job 35:13

God therefore will not hear in vain, and the Almighty will look into the causes of every one.


<a id="org3b23486"></a>

## Job 35:14

Yea, when thou shalt say: He considereth not: be judged before him, and expect him.


<a id="org5280bef"></a>

## Job 35:15

For he doth not now bring on his fury, neither doth he revenge wickedness exceedingly.


<a id="orgfa497dd"></a>

## Job 35:16

Therefore Job openeth his mouth in vain, and multiplieth words without knowledge. 


<a id="orgb092cd4"></a>

Eliu also proceeded, and said:

Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee: for I have yet somewhat to speak in God&rsquo;s behalf.

## Job 36:3

I will repeat my knowledge from the beginning, and I will prove my Maker just.


<a id="orge500ac3"></a>

## Job 36:4

For indeed my words are without a lie, and perfect knowledge shall be proved to thee.


<a id="orgb750251"></a>

## Job 36:5

God doth not cast away the mighty, whereas he himself also is mighty.


<a id="org5d35f40"></a>

## Job 36:6

But he saveth not the wicked, and he giveth judgment to the poor.


<a id="orgcd257b0"></a>

He will not take away his eyes from the just, and he placeth kings on the throne for ever, and they are exalted.

## Job 36:8

And if they shall be in chains, and be bound with the cords of poverty:


<a id="orgd5cb773"></a>

## Job 36:9

He shall shew them their works, and their wicked deeds, because they have been violent.


<a id="org4fc2445"></a>

## Job 36:10

He also shall open their ear, to correct them: and shall speak, that they may return from iniquity.

## Job 36:11

If they shall hear and observe, they shall accomplish their days in good, and their years in glory.

## Job 36:12

But if they hear not, they shall pass by the sword, and shall be consumed in folly.

Dissemblers and crafty men prove the wrath of God, neither shall they cry when they are bound.

Their soul shall die in a storm, and their life among the effeminate.

Therefore he shall set thee at large out of the narrow mouth, and which hath no foundation under it: and the rest of thy table shall be full of fatness.

Thy cause hath been judged as that of the wicked, cause and judgment thou shalt recover.

Therefore let not anger overcome thee to oppress any man: neither let multitude of gifts turn thee aside.
