# Exodus 1


<a id="org87ea4ce"></a>

## Exodus 1:1

These are the names of the children of Israel, that went into Egypt with Jacob: they went in every man with his household:


<a id="org7b0793d"></a>

## Exodus 1:2

Ruben, Simeon, Levi, Juda,


<a id="orge6b70af"></a>

## Exodus 1:3

Issachar, Zabulon, and Benjamin,


<a id="org823d60e"></a>

## Exodus 1:4

Dan, and Nephthali, Gad and Aser.


<a id="org33a49e3"></a>

## Exodus 1:5

And all the souls that came out of Jacob&rsquo;s thigh, were seventy: but Joseph was in Egypt.


<a id="orgb045a60"></a>

## Exodus 1:6

After he was dead, and all his brethren, and all that generation,


<a id="orgbbdbfc6"></a>

## Exodus 1:7

The children of Israel increased, and sprung up into multitudes, and growing exceedingly strong they filled the land.


<a id="org496c4c0"></a>

## Exodus 1:8

In the mean time there arose a new king over Egypt, that knew not Joseph:


<a id="org5f45d19"></a>

## Exodus 1:9

And he said to his people: Behold the people of the children of Israel are numerous and stronger than we.


<a id="org335abc4"></a>

## Exodus 1:10

Come let us wisely oppress them, lest they multiply: and if any war shall rise against us, join with our enemies, and having overcome us, depart out of the land.


<a id="orgf9b0f9f"></a>

## Exodus 1:11

Therefore he set over them masters of the works, to afflict them with burdens: and they built for Pharao cities of tabernacles, Phithom, and Ramesses.


<a id="org7d90828"></a>

## Exodus 1:12

But the more they oppressed them, the more they were multiplied and increased.


<a id="org5e5fddd"></a>

## Exodus 1:13

And the Egyptians hated the children of Israel, and afflicted them and mocked them:


<a id="orge06551c"></a>

## Exodus 1:14

And they made their life bitter with hard works in clay and brick, and with all manner of service, wherewith they were overcharged in the works of the earth.


<a id="org7ee8605"></a>

## Exodus 1:15

And the king of Egypt spoke to the midwives of the Hebrews: of whom one was called Sephora, the other Phua,


<a id="orgce8df2b"></a>

## Exodus 1:16

Commanding them: When you shall do the office of midwives to the Hebrew women, and the time of delivery is come: if it be a man child, kill it: if a woman, keep it alive.


<a id="orga77075b"></a>

## Exodus 1:17

But the midwives feared God, and did not do as the king of Egypt had commanded, but saved the men children.


<a id="org0d38b75"></a>

## Exodus 1:18

And the king called for them and said: What is it that you meant to do, that you would save the men children?


<a id="orgabd2815"></a>

## Exodus 1:19

They answered: The Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women: for they themselves are skilful in the office of a midwife; and they are delivered before we come to them.


<a id="org7f2438a"></a>

## Exodus 1:20

Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied and grew exceedingly strong.


<a id="orgb771494"></a>

## Exodus 1:21

And because the midwives feared God, he built them houses.


<a id="orgf2bfedf"></a>

## Exodus 1:22

Pharao therefore charged all his people, saying: Whatsoever shall be born of the male sex, ye shall cast into the river: whatsoever of the female, ye shall save alive. 


<a id="org47818f9"></a>

# Exodus 2


<a id="org2ef3e29"></a>

## Exodus 2:1

After this there went a man of the house of Levi; and took a wife of his own kindred.


<a id="orgbe4c1e6"></a>

## Exodus 2:2

And she conceived, and bore a son: and seeing him a goodly child, hid him three months.


<a id="org32fc3c0"></a>

## Exodus 2:3

And when she could hide him no longer, she took a basket made of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and pitch: and put the little babe therein, and laid him in the sedges by the river&rsquo;s brink,


<a id="org531bc29"></a>

## Exodus 2:4

His sister standing afar off, and taking notice what would be done.


<a id="org7da8af8"></a>

## Exodus 2:5

And behold the daughter of Pharao came down to wash herself in the river: and her maids walked by the river&rsquo;s brink. And when she saw the basket in the sedges she sent one of her maids for it: and when it was brought,


<a id="org1cdee1d"></a>

## Exodus 2:6

She opened it, and seeing within it an infant crying, having compassion on it, she said: This is one of the babes of the Hebrews.


<a id="org083e9a8"></a>

## Exodus 2:7

And the child&rsquo;s sister said to her: Shall I go, and call to thee a Hebrew woman, to nurse the babe?


<a id="orgdd66882"></a>

## Exodus 2:8

She answered: Go. The maid went and called her mother.


<a id="orga6cc7a6"></a>

## Exodus 2:9

And Pharao&rsquo;s daughter said to her: Take this child, and nurse him for me: I will give thee thy wages. The woman took and nursed the child: and when he was grown up, she delivered him to Pharao&rsquo;s daughter.


<a id="orgec3ad4e"></a>

## Exodus 2:10

And she adopted him for a son, and called him Moses, saying: Because I took him out of the water.


<a id="orga73ce41"></a>

## Exodus 2:11

In those days, after Moses was grown up, he went out to his brethren: and saw their affliction, and an Egyptian striking one of the Hebrews, his brethren.


<a id="org5a39a2d"></a>

## Exodus 2:12

And when he had looked about this way and that way, and saw no one there, he slew the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.

Because the things that were offered did suffice, and were too much.


<a id="orgbde30ba"></a>

## Exodus 36:8

And all the men that were wise of heart, to accomplish the work of the tabernacle, made ten curtains of twisted fine linen, and violet, and purple, and scarlet twice dyed, with varied work, and the art of embroidering:

The length of one curtain was twenty-eight cubits, and the breadth four: all the curtains were of the same size.

## Exodus 36:10

And he joined five curtains, one to another, and the other five he coupled one to another.


<a id="org762d050"></a>

He made also loops of violet in the edge of one curtain on both sides, and in the edge of the other curtain in like manner,


<a id="org3527ea6"></a>

## Exodus 36:12

That the loops might meet one against another, and might be joined each with the other.


<a id="orgbfed9ab"></a>

Five of which he joined apart, and the other six apart.


<a id="org873cab5"></a>

And he made fifty loops in the edge of one curtain, and fifty in the edge of another curtain, that they might be joined one to another.


<a id="orgf255920"></a>

<a id="org516a98e"></a>

## Exodus 36:21

The length of one board was ten cubits; and the breadth was one cubit and a half.


<a id="orge1bfc36"></a>

## Exodus 36:22

There were two mortises throughout every board, that one might be joined to the other. And in this manner he made for all the boards of the tabernacle.


<a id="orgc8374bc"></a>

## Exodus 36:23

Of which twenty were at the south side southward,


<a id="org9d6c6a0"></a>

## Exodus 36:24

With forty sockets of silver, two sockets were put under one board on the two sides of the corners, where the mortises of the sides end in the corners.


<a id="orgf6aed2f"></a>

## Exodus 36:25

At that side also of the tabernacle, that looketh towards the north, he made twenty boards,


<a id="org0bafb19"></a>

## Exodus 36:26

With forty sockets of silver, two sockets for every board.


<a id="org2062b18"></a>

## Exodus 36:27

But against the west, to wit, at that side of the tabernacle, which looketh to the sea, he made six boards,


<a id="org46239c4"></a>

## Exodus 36:28

And two others at each corner of the tabernacle behind:


<a id="orgc0a27cf"></a>

## Exodus 36:29

Which were also joined from beneath unto the top, and went together into one joint. Thus he did on both sides at the corners:


<a id="org46776e4"></a>

## Exodus 36:30

So there were in all eight boards, and they had sixteen sockets of silver, to wit, two sockets under every board.


<a id="org508a787"></a>

## Exodus 36:31

He made also bars of setim wood, five to hold together the boards of one side of the tabernacle,


<a id="org54dd8c9"></a>

## Exodus 36:32

And five others to join together the boards of the other side; and besides these, five other bars at the west side of the tabernacle towards the sea.


<a id="orgcf83f7d"></a>

## Exodus 36:33

He made also another bar, that might come by the midst of the boards from corner to corner.


<a id="orgca5a9c9"></a>

## Exodus 36:34

And the boards themselves he overlaid with gold casting for them sockets of silver. And their rings he made of gold, through which the bars might be drawn: and he covered the bars themselves with plates of gold.


<a id="org8de2b4f"></a>

## Exodus 36:35

He made also a veil of violet, and purple, scarlet and fine twisted linen, varied and distinguished with embroidery:


<a id="orgc22882a"></a>

## Exodus 37:1

And Beseleel made also, the ark of setim wood: it was two cubits and a half in length, and a cubit and a half in breadth, and the height was of one cubit and a half: and he overlaid it with the purest gold within and without.


<a id="org58c311c"></a>

## Exodus 37:2

Casting four rings of gold at the four corners thereof: two rings in one side, and two in the other.


<a id="orgf118284"></a>

And he made bars of setim wood, which he overlaid with gold,


<a id="org043e5bb"></a>

## Exodus 37:5

And he put them into the rings that were at the sides of the ark to carry it.


<a id="orgf226c7a"></a>

## Exodus 37:6

He made also the propitiatory, that is, the oracle, of the purest gold, two cubits and a half in length, and a cubit and a half in breadth.


<a id="orgbc44987"></a>

## Exodus 37:7

Two cherubims also of beaten gold, which he set on the two sides of the propitiatory:


<a id="org170c116"></a>

## Exodus 37:8

One cherub in the top of one side, and the other cherub in the top of the other side: two cherubims at the two ends of the propitiatory,


<a id="org7054dea"></a>

## Exodus 37:9

Spreading their wings, and covering the propitiatory, and looking one towards the other, and towards it.


<a id="org997f05e"></a>

## Exodus 37:10

He made also the table of setim wood, in length two cubits, and in breadth one cubit, and in height it was a cubit and a half.


<a id="org3cd4536"></a>

## Exodus 37:11

And he overlaid it with the finest gold, and he made to it a golden ledge round about,


<a id="org6498c27"></a>

## Exodus 37:12

And to the ledge itself he made a polished crown of gold, of four fingers breadth, and upon the same another golden crown.


<a id="orgd3f9d2f"></a>

## Exodus 37:13

And he cast four rings of gold, which he put in the four corners at each foot of the table,


<a id="orgc068390"></a>

## Exodus 37:14

Over against the crown: and he put the bars into them, that the table might be carried.


<a id="org9280a09"></a>

## Exodus 37:15

The bars also themselves he made of setim wood, and overlaid them with gold.


<a id="orgb07aef1"></a>

And the vessels for the divers uses of the table, dishes, bowls, and cups, and censers of pure gold, wherein the libations are to be offered.

## Exodus 37:18

Six on the two sides: three branches on one side, and three on the other.


<a id="org2146b10"></a>

## Exodus 37:19

Three cups in manner of a nut on each branch, and bowls withal and lilies: and three cups of the fashion of a nut in another branch, and bowls withal and lilies. The work of the six branches, that went out from the shaft of the candlestick was equal.


<a id="org980d0f6"></a>

## Exodus 37:20

And in the shaft itself were four cups after the manner of a nut, and bowls withal at every one, and lilies:


<a id="org048b797"></a>

## Exodus 37:21

And bowls under two branches in three places, which together made six branches going out from one shaft.

<a id="org98a33d8"></a>

## Exodus 39:1

And he made, of violet and purple, scarlet and fine linen, the vestments for Aaron to wear when he ministered in the holy places, as the Lord commanded Moses.


<a id="org9c47378"></a>

## Exodus 39:2

So he made an ephod of gold, violet, and purple, and scarlet twice dyed, and fine twisted linen,


<a id="orgc4e0b1a"></a>

## Exodus 39:3

With embroidered work, and he cut thin plates of gold, and drew them small into threads, that they might be twisted with the woof of the foresaid colours,


<a id="org10896d3"></a>

## Exodus 39:4

And two borders coupled one to the other in the top on either side,


<a id="org5b01f11"></a>

## Exodus 39:5

And a girdle of the same colours, as the Lord had commanded Moses.


<a id="orgb744182"></a>

## Exodus 39:6

He prepared also two onyx stones, fast set and closed in gold, and graven, by the art of a lapidary, with the names of the children of Israel:


<a id="org63f99d3"></a>

## Exodus 39:7

And he set them in the sides of the ephod, for a memorial of the children of Israel, as the Lord had commanded Moses.


<a id="orgd966917"></a>

## Exodus 39:8

He made also a rational with embroidered work, according to the work of the ephod, of gold, violet, purple, and scarlet twice dyed, and fine twisted linen:


<a id="org57c15b9"></a>

## Exodus 39:9

Foursquare, double, of the measure of a span.


<a id="org32fe488"></a>

## Exodus 39:10

And he set four rows of precious stones in it. In the first row was a sardius, a topaz, an emerald.


<a id="org478a027"></a>

## Exodus 39:11

In the second, a carbuncle, a sapphire, and a jasper.


<a id="orgc9fa71a"></a>

## Exodus 39:12

In the third, a ligurius, an agate, and an amethyst.


<a id="orgb84b933"></a>

## Exodus 39:13

In the fourth, a chrysolite, an onyx, and a beryl, set and enclosed in gold by their rows.


<a id="orgaae72bf"></a>

## Exodus 39:14

And the twelve stones, were engraved with the names of the twelve tribes of Israel, each one with its several name.


<a id="org39234a3"></a>

## Exodus 39:15

They made also in the rational little chains, linked one to another, of the purest gold,


<a id="org233b850"></a>

## Exodus 39:16

And two hooks, and as many rings of gold. And they set the rings on either side of the rational,


<a id="org795e571"></a>

## Exodus 39:17

On which rings the two golden chains should hang, which they put into the hooks that stood out in the corners of the ephod.


<a id="org02f02ba"></a>

## Exodus 39:18

These both before and behind so answered one another, that the ephod and the rational were bound together,


<a id="orga4f8420"></a>

## Exodus 39:19

Being fastened to the girdle, and strongly coupled with rings, which a violet fillet joined, lest they should flag loose, and be moved one from the other, as the Lord commanded Moses.


<a id="org65e0189"></a>

## Exodus 39:20

They made also the tunic of the ephod all of violet,


<a id="orgc26c39a"></a>

## Exodus 39:21

And a hole for the head in the upper part at the middle, and a woven border round about the hole:


<a id="org584809e"></a>

## Exodus 39:22

And beneath at the feet pomegranates of violet, purple, scarlet, and fine twisted linen:


<a id="orgd930135"></a>

## Exodus 39:23

And little bells of the purest gold, which they put between the pomegranates at the bottom of the tunic round about:


<a id="org424fd68"></a>

## Exodus 39:24

To wit, a bell of gold, and a pomegranate, wherewith the high priest went adorned, when he discharged his ministry, as the Lord had commanded Moses.


<a id="orgfce310d"></a>

## Exodus 39:25

They made also fine linen tunics with woven work for Aaron and his sons:


<a id="orga09ea88"></a>

## Exodus 39:26

And mitres with their little crowns of fine linen:


<a id="org812afd0"></a>

## Exodus 39:27

And linen breeches of fine linen:


<a id="org0624a4a"></a>

## Exodus 39:28

And a girdle of fine twisted linen, violet, purple, and scarlet twice dyed, of embroidery work, as the Lord had commanded Moses.


<a id="org68220b3"></a>

## Exodus 39:29

They made also the plate of sacred veneration of the purest gold, and they wrote on it with the engraving of a lapidary: The Holy of the Lord:


<a id="orgc432784"></a>

## Exodus 39:30

And they fastened it to the mitre with a violet fillet, as the Lord had commanded Moses.


<a id="org3a5b080"></a>

## Exodus 39:31

So all the work of the tabernacle and of the roof of the testimony was finished: and the children of Israel did all things which the Lord had commanded Moses.


<a id="org020edad"></a>

## Exodus 39:32

And they offered the tabernacle, and the roof, and the whole furniture, the rings, the boards, the bars, the pillars and their sockets,


<a id="orgfefde0c"></a>

## Exodus 39:33

The cover of rams&rsquo; skins dyed red, and the other cover of violet skins,


<a id="org4fbf036"></a>

## Exodus 39:34

The veil, the ark, the bars, the propitiatory,


<a id="org37a199f"></a>

## Exodus 39:35

The table, with the vessels thereof, and the loaves of proposition:


<a id="orgec64d76"></a>

## Exodus 39:36

The candlestick, the lamps, and the furniture of them, with the oil:


<a id="org0aefea3"></a>

## Exodus 39:37

The altar of gold, and the ointment, and the incense of spices:


<a id="orgce838bf"></a>

## Exodus 39:38

And the hanging in the entry of the tabernacle:


<a id="orgc739f9b"></a>

## Exodus 39:39

The altar of brass, the grate, the bars, and all the vessels thereof: the laver, with the foot thereof: the hangings of the court, and the pillars, with their sockets:


<a id="org8f44677"></a>

## Exodus 39:40

The hanging in the entry of the court, and the little cords, and the pins thereof. Nothing was wanting of the vessels, that were commanded to be made for the ministry of the tabernacle, and for the roof of the covenant.


<a id="org0459f57"></a>

## Exodus 39:41

The vestments also, which the priests, to wit, Aaron and his sons, use in the sanctuary,


<a id="org2c436e8"></a>

## Exodus 39:42

The children of Israel offered, as the Lord had commanded.


<a id="orgbcc942c"></a>

<a id="org8c904bc"></a>

And Moses did all that the Lord had commanded.


<a id="orga60d719"></a>

## Exodus 40:15

So in the first month of the second year, the first day of the month, the tabernacle was set up.


<a id="org6fd6dd6"></a>

## Exodus 40:16

And Moses reared it up, and placed the boards and the sockets and the bars, and set up the pillars,


<a id="orgbd889e8"></a>

## Exodus 40:17

And spread the roof over the tabernacle, putting over it a cover, as the Lord had commanded.


<a id="org0a330d1"></a>

## Exodus 40:18

And he put the testimony in the ark, thrusting bars underneath, and the oracle above.


<a id="org8082812"></a>

<a id="org15bcb4c"></a>

## Exodus 40:20

And he set the table in the tabernacle of the testimony, at the north side, without the veil,


<a id="orgdcaf945"></a>

Setting there in order the loaves of proposition, as the Lord had commanded Moses.


<a id="org55b9c33"></a>

## Exodus 40:22

He set the candlestick also in the tabernacle of the testimony, over against the table on the south side,

Placing the lamps in order, according to the precept of the Lord.


<a id="orgff9a121"></a>

<a id="orgef98d61"></a>

He set up also the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, drawing the hanging in the entry thereof. After all things were perfected,


<a id="orge697d72"></a>

## Exodus 40:32

The cloud covered the tabernacle of the testimony, and the glory of the Lord filled it.


<a id="orgb93a936"></a>

## Exodus 40:33

Neither could Moses go into the tabernacle of the covenant, the cloud covering all things, and the majesty of the Lord shining, for the cloud had covered all.


<a id="orgbe0875a"></a>

## Exodus 40:34

If at any time the cloud removed from the tabernacle, the children of Israel went forward by their troops:


<a id="org2d003cf"></a>

## Exodus 40:35

If it hung over, they remained in the same place.


<a id="org8b8ea60"></a>

## Exodus 40:36

For the cloud of the Lord hung over the tabernacle by day, and a fire by night, in the sight of all the children of Israel throughout all their mansions.
