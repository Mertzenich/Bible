# Joshua 1


<a id="org3d4e23d"></a>

## Joshua 1:1

Now it came to pass after the death of Moses, the servant of the Lord, that the Lord spoke to Joshua, the son of Nun, the minister of Moses, and said to him:


<a id="org73c16f9"></a>

## Joshua 1:2

Moses my servant is dead: arise, and pass over this Jordan, thou and thy people with thee, into the land which I will give to the children of Israel.


<a id="org3cf52a9"></a>

## Joshua 1:3

I will deliver to you every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, as I have said to Moses.


<a id="orgadc870c"></a>

## Joshua 1:4

From the desert, and from Libanus unto the great river Euphrates, all the land of the Hethites, unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your border.


<a id="orge1b803f"></a>

## Joshua 1:5

No man shall be able to resist you all the days of thy life: as I have been with Moses, so will I be with thee: I will not leave thee, nor forsake thee.


<a id="orge4e1a60"></a>

## Joshua 1:6

Take courage, and be strong: for thou shalt divide by lot to this people the land for which I swore to their fathers, that I would deliver it to them.


<a id="org0fe9766"></a>

## Joshua 1:7

Take courage therefore, and be very valiant: that thou mayst observe and do all the law, which Moses my servant hath commanded thee: turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayst understand all things which thou dost.


<a id="org9fa123d"></a>

## Joshua 1:8

Let not the book of this law depart from thy mouth: but thou shalt meditate on it day and night, that thou mayst observe and do all things that are written in it: then shalt thou direct thy way, and understand it.


<a id="org885646a"></a>

## Joshua 1:9

Behold I command thee, take courage, and be strong. Fear not, and be not dismayed: because the Lord thy God is with thee in all things whatsoever thou shalt go to.


<a id="org856d8f6"></a>

## Joshua 1:10

And Joshua commanded the princes of the people, saying: Pass through the midst of the camp, and command the people, and say:


<a id="org076cb74"></a>

## Joshua 1:11

Prepare your victuals: for after the third day you shall pass over the Jordan, and shall go in to possess the land, which the Lord your God will give you.


<a id="orgb3c4784"></a>

## Joshua 1:12

And he said to the Rubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasses:


<a id="orgdf4f154"></a>

## Joshua 1:13

Remember the word, which Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you, saying: The Lord your God hath given you rest, and all this land.


<a id="org5ab2aea"></a>

## Joshua 1:14

Your wives, and children; and cattle, shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side of the Jordan: but pass you over armed before your brethren all of you that are strong of hand, and fight for them,


<a id="orga9960f2"></a>

## Joshua 1:15

Until the Lord give rest to your brethren, as he hath given you, and they also possess the land which the Lord your God will give them: and so you shall return into the land of your possession, and you shall dwell in it, which Moses the servant of the Lord gave you beyond the Jordan, toward the rising of the sun.


<a id="org443c7a8"></a>

## Joshua 1:16

And they made answer to Joshua, and said: All that thou hast commanded us, we will do: and whither soever thou shalt send us, we will go.


<a id="orgc21daa5"></a>

## Joshua 1:17

As we obeyed Moses in all things, so will we obey thee also: only be the Lord thy God with thee, as he was with Moses.


<a id="orgb257a6a"></a>

## Joshua 1:18

He that shall gainsay thy mouth, and not obey all thy words, that thou shalt command him, let him die: only take thou courage, and do manfully. 


<a id="orgb830bf2"></a>

# Joshua 2


<a id="orgfae32b8"></a>

## Joshua 2:1

And Joshua, the son of Nun, sent from Setim two men, to spy secretly: and said to them: Go, and view the land, and the city of Jericho. They went, and entered into the house of a woman that was a harlot, named Rahab, and lodged with her.


<a id="orgfeaddd1"></a>

## Joshua 2:2

And it was told the king of Jericho, and was said: Behold there are men come in hither, by night, of the children of Israel, to spy the land.


<a id="org6509346"></a>

## Joshua 2:3

And the king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying: Bring forth the men that came to thee, and are entered into thy house: for they are spies, and are come to view all the land.


<a id="orgf6111a6"></a>

## Joshua 2:4

And the woman taking the men, hid them, and said: I confess they came to me, but I knew not whence they were:


<a id="orgf6ab3d8"></a>

## Joshua 2:5

And at the time of shutting the gate in the dark, they also went out together. I know not whither they are gone: pursue after them quickly, and you will overtake them.


<a id="orgd68cd02"></a>

## Joshua 2:6

But she made the men go up to the top of her house, and covered them with the stalks of flax, which was there.


<a id="org5bd7181"></a>

## Joshua 2:7

Now they that were sent, pursued after them, by the way that leadeth to the fords of the Jordan: and as soon as they were gone out, the gate was presently shut.


<a id="org15203fd"></a>

## Joshua 2:8

The men that were hid were not yet asleep, when behold the woman went up to them, and said:


<a id="org6b9c22e"></a>

## Joshua 2:9

I know that the Lord hath given this land to you: for the dread of you is fallen upon us, and all the inhabitants of the land have lost all strength.


<a id="org67428ee"></a>

## Joshua 2:10

We have heard that the Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea, at your going in, when you came out of Egypt: and what things you did to the two kings of the Amorrhites, that were beyond the Jordan, Sehon and Og whom you slew.


<a id="org0b80a97"></a>

## Joshua 2:11

And at the hearing these things, we were affrighted, and our heart fainted away, neither did there remain any spirit in us, at your coming in: for the Lord your God he is God in heaven above, and in the earth beneath.


<a id="org9ab8a25"></a>

## Joshua 2:12

Now, therefore, swear ye to me by the Lord, that as I have shewed mercy to you, so you also will shew mercy to my father&rsquo;s house: and give me a true token.


<a id="orge92cd37"></a>

## Joshua 2:13

That you will save my father and mother, my brethren and sisters, and all things that are theirs, and deliver our souls from death.


<a id="orgf2bba15"></a>

## Joshua 2:14

They answered her: Be our lives for you unto death, only if thou betray us not. And when the Lord shall have delivered us the land, we will shew thee mercy and truth.


<a id="org364d716"></a>

## Joshua 2:15

Then she let them down with a cord out of a window: for her house joined close to the wall.


<a id="org134e231"></a>

## Joshua 2:16

And she said to them: Get ye up to the mountains, lest perhaps they meet you as they return: and there lie ye hid three days, till they come back, and so you shall go on your way.


<a id="org53439dc"></a>

## Joshua 2:17

And they said to her: We shall be blameless of this oath, which thou hast made us swear,


<a id="org6967869"></a>

## Joshua 2:18

If, when we come into the land, this scarlet cord be a sign, and thou tie it in the window, by which thou hast let us down: and gather together thy father and mother, and brethren, and all thy kindred into thy house.


<a id="orgcf395d3"></a>

## Joshua 2:19

Whosoever shall go out of the door of thy house, his blood shall be upon his own head, and we shall be quit. But the blood of all that shall be with thee in the house, shall light upon our head, if any man touch them.


<a id="orgb170d6e"></a>

## Joshua 2:20

But if thou wilt betray us, and utter this word abroad, we shall be quit of this oath, which thou hast made us swear.


<a id="org950d25e"></a>

## Joshua 2:21

And she answered: As you have spoken, so be it done: and sending them on their way, she hung the scarlet cord in the window.


<a id="org39d6a9b"></a>

## Joshua 2:22

But they went and came to the mountains, and stayed there three days, till they that pursued them were returned. For having sought them through all the way, they found them not.


<a id="org10ba01f"></a>

## Joshua 2:23

And when they were gone back into the city, the spies returned, and came down from the mountain: and passing over the Jordan, they came to Joshua, the son of Nun, and told him all that befel them,


<a id="orgc8a70c1"></a>

## Joshua 2:24

And said: the Lord hath delivered all this land into our hands, and all the inhabitants thereof are overthrown with fear. 


<a id="org2a834ec"></a>

# Joshua 3


<a id="org3c21687"></a>

## Joshua 3:1

And Joshua rose before daylight, and removed the camp: and they departed from Setim, and came to the Jordan: he, and all the children of Israel, and they abode there for three days.


<a id="orga562187"></a>

## Joshua 3:2

After which, the heralds went through the midst of the camp,


<a id="org45ccd85"></a>

## Joshua 3:3

And began to proclaim: When you shall see the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God, and the priests of the race of Levi carrying it, rise you up also, and follow them as they go before:


<a id="org96ca0a5"></a>

## Joshua 3:4

And let there be between you and the ark the space of two thousand cubits: that you may see it afar off, and know which way you must go: for you have not gone this way before: and take care you come not near the ark.


<a id="org6f0018e"></a>

## Joshua 3:5

And Joshua said to the people: Be ye sanctified: for tomorrow the Lord will do wonders among you.


<a id="org198cf49"></a>

## Joshua 3:6

And he said to the priests: Take up the ark of the covenant, and go before the people. And they obeyed his commands, and took it up, and walked before them.


<a id="org55528e9"></a>

## Joshua 3:7

And the Lord said to Joshua: This day will I begin to exalt thee before Israel: that they may know that as I was with Moses, so I am with thee also.


<a id="orgaaf06f1"></a>

## Joshua 3:8

And do thou command the priests, that carry the ark of the covenant, and say to them: When you shall have entered into part of the water of the Jordan, stand in it.


<a id="orga4117a3"></a>

## Joshua 3:9

And Joshua said to the children of Israel: Come hither, and hear the word of the Lord your God.


<a id="org87669c8"></a>

## Joshua 3:10

And again he said: By this you shall know, that the Lord, the living God, is in the midst of you, and that he shall destroy, before your sight, the Chanaanite and the Hethite, the Hevite and the Pherezite, the Gergesite also, and the Jebusite, and the Amorrhite.


<a id="orgbfca95b"></a>

## Joshua 3:11

Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth shall go before you into the Jordan.


<a id="orgf07c917"></a>

## Joshua 3:12

Prepare ye twelve men of the tribes of Israel, one of every tribe.


<a id="orgae83c33"></a>

## Joshua 3:13

And when the priests, that carry the ark of the Lord the God of the whole earth, shall set the soles of their feet in the waters of the Jordan, the waters that are beneath shall run down and go off: and those that come from above, shall stand together upon a heap.


<a id="orgce027eb"></a>

## Joshua 3:14

So the people went out of their tents, to pass over the Jordan: and the priests that carried the ark of the covenant, went on before them.


<a id="org77d5f0a"></a>

## Joshua 3:15

And as soon as they came into the Jordan, and their feet were dipped in part of the water, (now the Jordan, it being harvest time, had filled the banks of its channel,)


<a id="org28be4ee"></a>

## Joshua 3:16

The waters that came down from above stood in one place, and swelling up like a mountain, were seen afar off, from the city that is called Adom, to the place of Sarthan: but those that were beneath, ran down into the sea of the wilderness, (which now is called the Dead Sea) until they wholly failed.


<a id="org436e301"></a>

## Joshua 3:17

And the people marched over against Jericho: and the priests that carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord, stood girded upon the dry ground in the midst of the Jordan, and all the people passed over, through the channel that was dried up. 


<a id="orga37c5ff"></a>

# Joshua 4


<a id="orgb74d07a"></a>

## Joshua 4:1

And when they were passed over, the Lord said to Joshua:


<a id="org68b3c10"></a>

## Joshua 4:2

Choose twelve men, one of every tribe:


<a id="org0d7e019"></a>

## Joshua 4:3

And command them to take out of the midst of the Jordan, where the feet of the priests stood, twelve very hard stones, which you shall set in the place of the camp, where you shall pitch your tents this night.


<a id="orgba033d6"></a>

## Joshua 4:4

And Joshua called twelve men, whom he had chosen out of the children of Israel, one out of every tribe,


<a id="orgbae9aef"></a>

## Joshua 4:5

And he said to them: Go before the ark of the Lord your God to the midst of the Jordan, and carry from thence every man a stone on your shoulders, according to the number of the children of Israel,


<a id="orgcbbc842"></a>

## Joshua 4:6

That it may be a sign among you: and when your children shall ask you tomorrow, saying: What means these stones?


<a id="org15f8bbf"></a>

## Joshua 4:7

You shall answer them: The waters of the Jordan ran off before the ark of the covenant of the Lord when it passed over the same: therefore were these stones set for a monument of the children of Israel forever.


<a id="orge1bb8c6"></a>

## Joshua 4:8

The children of Israel therefore did as Joshua commanded them, carrying out of the channel of the Jordan twelve stones, as the Lord had commanded him according to the number of the children of Israel unto the place wherein they camped, and there they set them.


<a id="orgc5df91c"></a>

## Joshua 4:9

And Joshua put other twelve stones in the midst of the channel of the Jordan, where the priests stood that carried the ark of the covenant: and they are there until this present day.


<a id="org5272453"></a>

## Joshua 4:10

Now the priests that carried the ark, stood in the midst of the Jordan, till all things were accomplished, which the Lord had commanded Joshua to speak to the people, and Moses had said to him. And the people made haste, and passed over.


<a id="org707daaa"></a>

## Joshua 4:11

And when they had all passed over, the ark also of the Lord passed over, and the priests went before the people.


<a id="orgbe6f31f"></a>

## Joshua 4:12

The children of Ruben also, and Gad, and half the tribe of Manasses, went armed before the children of Israel, as Moses had commanded them.


<a id="org427e77f"></a>

## Joshua 4:13

And forty thousand fighting men by their troops and bands, marched through the plains and fields of the city of Jericho.


<a id="org625ff17"></a>

## Joshua 4:14

In that day the Lord magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel, that they should fear him, as they had feared Moses, while he lived.


<a id="orgebaf855"></a>

## Joshua 4:15

And he said to him:


<a id="org8f72f54"></a>

## Joshua 4:16

Command the priests, that carry the ark of the covenant, to come up out of the Jordan.


<a id="org601cdd1"></a>

## Joshua 4:17

And he commanded them, saying: Come ye up out of the Jordan.


<a id="orgea0a88f"></a>

## Joshua 4:18

And when they that carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord, were come up, and began to tread on the dry ground, the waters returned into their channel, and ran as they were wont before.


<a id="org7a667eb"></a>

## Joshua 4:19

And the people came up out of the Jordan, the tenth day of the first month, and camped in Galgal, over against the east side of the city of Jericho.


<a id="org5a264ea"></a>

## Joshua 4:20

And the twelve stones, which they had taken out of the channel of the Jordan, Joshua pitched in Galgal,


<a id="orge0549c6"></a>

## Joshua 4:21

And said to the children of Israel: When your children shall ask their fathers tomorrow, and shall say to them: What mean these stones?


<a id="orgb58ba11"></a>

## Joshua 4:22

You shall teach them, and say: Israel passed over this Jordan through the dry channel,


<a id="orgca3ffe1"></a>

## Joshua 4:23

The Lord your God drying up the waters thereof in your sight, until you passed over:


<a id="org232e3f4"></a>

## Joshua 4:24

As he had done before in the Red Sea, which he dried up till we passed through:


<a id="org43cee63"></a>

## Joshua 4:25

That all the people of the earth may learn the most mighty hand of the Lord, that you also may fear the Lord your God for ever. 


<a id="org798744f"></a>

# Joshua 5


<a id="orgb3304ac"></a>

## Joshua 5:1

Now when all the kings of the Amorrhites, who dwelt beyond the Jordan, westward, and all the kings of Chanaan, who possessed the places near the great sea, had heard that the Lord had dried up the waters of the Jordan before the children of Israel, till they passed over, their heart failed them, and there remained no spirit in them, fearing the coming in of the children of Israel.


<a id="org95005ba"></a>

## Joshua 5:2

At that time the Lord said to Joshua: Make thee knives of stone, and circumcise the second time the children of Israel.


<a id="org9d10bc9"></a>

## Joshua 5:3

He did what the Lord had commanded, and he circumcised the children of Israel in the hill of the foreskins.


<a id="orgd402f34"></a>

## Joshua 5:4

Now this is the cause of the second circumcision: All the people that came out of Egypt that were males, all the men fit for war, died in the desert, during the time of the long going about in the way:


<a id="org1b24394"></a>

## Joshua 5:5

Now these were all circumcised. But the people that were born in the desert,


<a id="orgfcee6f8"></a>

## Joshua 5:6

During the forty years of the journey in the wide wilderness, were uncircumcised: till all they were consumed that had not heard the voice of the Lord, and to whom he had sworn before, that he would not shew them the land flowing with milk and honey.


<a id="orgda5f5ec"></a>

## Joshua 5:7

The children of these succeeded in the place of their fathers, and were circumcised by Joshua: for they were uncircumcised even as they were born, and no one had circumcised them in the way.


<a id="orgb0ff7ef"></a>

## Joshua 5:8

Now after they were all circumcised, they remained in the same place of the camp, until they were healed.


<a id="org97afeb5"></a>

## Joshua 5:9

And the Lord said to Joshua: This day have I taken away from you the reproach of Egypt. And the name of that place was called Galgal, until this present day.


<a id="orgad3003b"></a>

## Joshua 5:10

And the children of Israel abode in Galgal, and they kept the phase, on the fourteenth day of the month at evening, in the plains of Jericho:


<a id="org672e57a"></a>

## Joshua 5:11

And they ate on the next day unleavened bread of the corn of the land, and frumenty of the same year.


<a id="orgc1160bb"></a>

## Joshua 5:12

And the manna ceased after they ate of the corn of the land, neither did the children of Israel use that food any more, but they ate of the corn of the present year of the land of Chanaan.


<a id="org3c9ddf4"></a>

## Joshua 5:13

And when Joshua was in the field of the city of Jericho, he lifted up his eyes, and saw a man standing over against him, holding a drawn sword, and he went to him, and said: Art thou one of ours, or of our adversaries?


<a id="orgd06c6ac"></a>

## Joshua 5:14

And he answered: No: but I am prince of the host of the Lord, and now I am come.


<a id="orgd530a7b"></a>

## Joshua 5:15

Joshua fell on his face to the ground. And worshipping, said: What saith my lord to his servant?


<a id="orgd045e78"></a>

## Joshua 5:16

Loose, saith he, thy shoes from off thy feet: for the place whereon thou standest is holy. And Joshua did as was commanded him. 


<a id="org2f65649"></a>

# Joshua 6


<a id="org1139262"></a>

## Joshua 6:1

Now Jericho was close shut up and fenced, for fear of the children of Israel, and no man durst go out or come in.


<a id="org0c1001f"></a>

## Joshua 6:2

And the Lord said to Joshua: Behold I have given into thy hands Jericho, and the king thereof, and all the valiant men.


<a id="org271d91d"></a>

## Joshua 6:3

Go round about the city all ye fighting men once a day: so shall ye do for six days.


<a id="orgee66c82"></a>

## Joshua 6:4

And on the seventh day the priests shall take the seven trumpets, which are used in the jubilee, and shall go before the ark of the covenant: and you shall go about the city seven times, and the priests shall sound the trumpets.


<a id="org42acf45"></a>

## Joshua 6:5

And when the voice of the trumpet shall give a longer and broken tune, and shall sound in your ears, all the people shall shout together with a very great shout, and the walls of the city shall fall to the ground, and they shall enter in every one at the place against which they shall stand.


<a id="org09c5eb3"></a>

## Joshua 6:6

Then Joshua, the son of Nun, called the priests, and said to them: Take the ark of the covenant: and let seven other priests take the seven trumpets of the jubilee, and march before the ark of the Lord.


<a id="org58bdb50"></a>

## Joshua 6:7

And he said to the people: Go, and compass the city, armed, marching before the ark of the Lord.


<a id="org5984456"></a>

## Joshua 6:8

And when Joshua had ended his words, and the seven priests blew the seven trumpets before the ark of the covenant of the Lord,


<a id="org1dcc71e"></a>

## Joshua 6:9

And all the armed men went before, the rest of the common people followed the ark, and the sound of the trumpets was heard on all sides.


<a id="org4a16cda"></a>

## Joshua 6:10

But Joshua had commanded the people, saying: You shall not shout, nor shall your voice be heard, nor any word go out of your mouth: until the day come wherein I shall say to you: Cry, and shout.


<a id="orge126405"></a>

## Joshua 6:11

So the ark of the Lord went about the city once a day, and returning into the camp, abode there.


<a id="orgeace330"></a>

## Joshua 6:12

And Joshua rising before day, the priests took the ark of the Lord,


<a id="orgc14d650"></a>

## Joshua 6:13

And seven of them seven trumpets, which are used in the jubilee: and they went before the ark of the Lord, walking and sounding the trumpets: and the armed men went before them, and the rest of the common people followed the ark, and they blew the trumpets.


<a id="orga1ce5f0"></a>

## Joshua 6:14

And they went round about the city the second day once, and returned into the camp. So they did six days.


<a id="org72d56fa"></a>

## Joshua 6:15

But the seventh day, rising up early, they went about the city, as it was ordered, seven times.


<a id="org1dc429a"></a>

## Joshua 6:16

And when in the seventh going about the priests sounded with the trumpets, Joshua said to all Israel: Shout: for the Lord hath delivered the city to you:


<a id="orgaaf9027"></a>

## Joshua 6:17

And let this city be an anathema, and all things that are in it, to the Lord. Let only Rahab, the harlot, live, with all that are with her in the house: for she hid the messengers whom we sent.


<a id="org48e1867"></a>

## Joshua 6:18

But beware ye lest you touch ought of those things that are forbidden, and you be guilty of transgression, and all the camp of Israel be under sin, and be troubled.


<a id="org128813a"></a>

## Joshua 6:19

But whatsoever gold or silver there shall be, or vessels of brass and iron, let it be consecrated to the Lord, laid up in his treasures.


<a id="orgf8bac96"></a>

## Joshua 6:20

So all the people making a shout, and the trumpets sounding, when the voice and the sound thundered in the ears of the multitude, the walls forthwith fell down: and every man went up by the place that was over against him: and they took the city,


<a id="org799361a"></a>

## Joshua 6:21

And killed all that were in it, man and woman, young and old. The oxen also, and the sheep, and the asses, they slew with the edge of the sword.


<a id="org6318775"></a>

## Joshua 6:22

But Joshua said to the two men that had been sent for spies: Go into the harlot&rsquo;s house, and bring her out, and all things that are hers, as you assured her by oath.


<a id="orga89ce20"></a>

## Joshua 6:23

And the young men went in, and brought out Rahab, and her parents, her brethren also, and all her goods, and her kindred, and made them to stay without the camp.


<a id="orge5da8ba"></a>

## Joshua 6:24

But they burned the city, and all things that were therein; except the gold and silver, and vessels of brass and iron, which they consecrated unto the treasury of the Lord. \_

## Joshua 6:25

But Joshua saved Rahab the harlot, and her father&rsquo;s house, and all she had, and they dwelt in the midst of Israel until this present day: because she hid the messengers whom he had sent to spy out Jericho. At that time, Joshua made an imprecation, saying:


<a id="orgd507cca"></a>

## Joshua 6:26

Cursed be the man before the Lord, that shall raise up and build the city of Jericho. In his firstborn may he lay the foundation thereof, and in the last of his children set up its gates.


<a id="orgc5c4c97"></a>

## Joshua 6:27

And the Lord was with Joshua, and his name was noised throughout all the land 


<a id="org07c515a"></a>

# Joshua 7


<a id="orgd5bf0c6"></a>

## Joshua 7:1

But the children of Israel transgressed the commandment, and took to their own use of that which was accursed. For Achan, the son of Charmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zare, of the tribe of Juda, took something of the anathema: and the Lord was angry against the children of Israel.


<a id="org1219ecb"></a>

## Joshua 7:2

And when Joshua sent men from Jericho against Hai, which is beside Bethaven, on the east side of the town of Bethel, he said to them: Go up, and view the country: and they fulfilled his command, and viewed Hai.


<a id="org9a30d55"></a>

## Joshua 7:3

And returning, they said to him: Let not all the people go up, but let two or three thousand men go, and destroy the city: why should all the people be troubled in vain, against enemies that are very few?


<a id="orga050f3f"></a>

## Joshua 7:4

There went up therefore three thousand fighting men: who immediately turned their backs,


<a id="org0db1052"></a>

## Joshua 7:5

And were defeated by the men of the city of Hai, and there fell of them six and thirty men: and the enemies pursued them from the gate as far as Sabarim, and they slew them as they fled by the descent: and the heart of the people was struck with fear, and melted like water.


<a id="org63f8eb7"></a>

## Joshua 7:6

But Joshua rent his garments, and fell flat on the ground, before the ark of the Lord, until the evening, both he and all the ancients of Israel: and they put dust upon their heads.


<a id="org0b17b4d"></a>

## Joshua 7:7

And Joshua said: Alas, O Lord God, why wouldst thou bring this people over the river Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorrhite, and to destroy us? would God we had stayed beyond the Jordan, as we began.


<a id="org1ceed27"></a>

## Joshua 7:8

My Lord God, what shall I say, seeing Israel turning their backs to their enemies?


<a id="org5ca8ce2"></a>

## Joshua 7:9

The Chanaanites, and all the inhabitants of the land, will hear of it, and being gathered together will surround us, and cut off our name from the earth: and what wilt thou do to thy great name?


<a id="orgf09268a"></a>

## Joshua 7:10

And the Lord said to Joshua: Arise, why liest thou flat on the ground?


<a id="org5c99d72"></a>

## Joshua 7:11

Israel hath sinned, and transgressed my covenant: and they have taken of the anathema, and have stolen and lied, and have hid it among their goods.


<a id="org101c194"></a>

## Joshua 7:12

Neither can Israel stand before his enemies, but he shall flee from them: because he is defiled with the anathema. I will be no more with you, till you destroy him that is guilty of this wickedness.


<a id="org5331ac5"></a>

## Joshua 7:13

Arise, sanctify the people, and say to them: Be ye sanctified against tomorrow: for thus saith the Lord God of Israel: The curse is in the midst of thee, O Israel: thou canst not stand before thy enemies, till he be destroyed out of thee, that is defiled with this wickedness.


<a id="org9aba8b1"></a>

## Joshua 7:14

And you shall come in the morning, every one by your tribes: and what tribe soever the lot shall find, it shall come by its kindreds, and the kindred by its houses and tho house by the men.


<a id="org6445e7a"></a>

## Joshua 7:15

And whosoever he be that shall be found guilty of this fact, he shall be burnt with fire, with all his substance, because he hath transgressed the covenant of the Lord, and hath done wickedness in Israel.


<a id="org8ec50b6"></a>

## Joshua 7:16

Joshua, therefore, when he rose in the morning, made Israel to come by their tribes, and the tribe of Juda was found.


<a id="org4c5f671"></a>

## Joshua 7:17

Which being brought by in families, it was found to be the family of Zare. Bringing that also by the houses, he found it to be Zabdi:


<a id="orga9a40b3"></a>

## Joshua 7:18

And bringing his house man by man, he found Achan, the son of Charmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zare, of the tribe of Juda.


<a id="org86ccc70"></a>

## Joshua 7:19

And Joshua said to Achan: My son, give glory to the Lord God of Israel, and confess, and tell me what thou hast done, hide it not.


<a id="orgfb4379f"></a>

## Joshua 7:20

And Achan answered Joshua, and said to him: Indeed I have sinned against the Lord, the God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done.


<a id="org37fc1b8"></a>

## Joshua 7:21

For I saw among the spoils a scarlet garment, exceeding good, and two hundred sicles of silver, and a golden rule of fifty sicles: and I coveted them, and I took them away, and hid them in the ground in the midst of my tent, and the silver I covered with the earth that I dug up.


<a id="orga7fdd04"></a>

## Joshua 7:22

Joshua therefore sent ministers: who running to his tent, found all hid in the same place, together with the silver.


<a id="orgb984501"></a>

## Joshua 7:23

And taking them away out of the tent, they brought them to Joshua, and to all the children of Israel, and threw them down before the Lord.


<a id="orgc6102fc"></a>

## Joshua 7:24

Then Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan, the son of Zare, and the silver, and the garment, and the golden rule, his sons also, and his daughters, his oxen, and asses, and sheep, the tent also, and all the goods: and brought them to the valley of Achor:


<a id="orge979a1d"></a>

## Joshua 7:25

Where Joshua said: Because thou hast troubled us, the Lord trouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him: and all things that were his, were consumed with fire.


<a id="orgb6c85ad"></a>

## Joshua 7:26

And they gathered together upon him a great heap of stones, which remaineth until this present day And the wrath of the Lord was turned away from them. And the name of that place was called the Valley of Achor, until this day. 


<a id="org0c6e676"></a>

# Joshua 8


<a id="orgd328964"></a>

## Joshua 8:1

And the Lord said to Joshua: Fear not, nor be thou dismayed: take with thee all the multitude of fighting men, arise, and go up to the town of Hai: Behold I have delivered into thy hand the king thereof, and the people, and the city, and the land.


<a id="org584271d"></a>

## Joshua 8:2

And thou shalt do to the city of Hai, and to the king thereof, as thou hast done to Jericho, and to the king thereof: but the spoils, and all the cattle, you shall take for a prey to yourselves: lay an ambush for the city behind it.


<a id="orge520041"></a>

## Joshua 8:3

And Joshua arose, and all the army of the fighting men with him, to go up against Hai: and he sent thirty thousand chosen valiant men in the night,


<a id="orge198a17"></a>

## Joshua 8:4

And commanded them, saying: Lay an ambush behind the city: and go not very far from it: and be ye all ready.


<a id="orgb37917f"></a>

## Joshua 8:5

But I, and the rest of the multitude which is with me, will approach on the contrary side against the city. And when they shall come out against us, we will flee, and turn our backs, as we did before:


<a id="orgfd85524"></a>

## Joshua 8:6

Till they pursuing us be drawn farther from the city: for they will think that we flee as before.


<a id="orge6722e7"></a>

## Joshua 8:7

And whilst we are fleeing, and they pursuing, you shall rise out of the ambush, and shall destroy the city: and the Lord your God will deliver it into your hands.


<a id="org2b417a1"></a>

## Joshua 8:8

And when you shall have taken it, set it on fire, and you shall do all things so as I have commanded.


<a id="orgfe9b49c"></a>

## Joshua 8:9

And he sent them away, and they went on to the place of the ambush, and abode between Bethel and Hai, on the west side of the city of Hai. But Joshua staid that night in the midst of the people,


<a id="org59f150f"></a>

## Joshua 8:10

And rising early in the morning, he mustered his soldiers, and went up with the ancients in the front of the army, environed with the aid of the fighting men.


<a id="org0f9894d"></a>

## Joshua 8:11

And when they were come, and were gone up over against the city, they stood on the north side of the city, between which and them there was a valley in the midst.


<a id="orgad173b5"></a>

## Joshua 8:12

And he had chosen five thousand men, and set them to lie in ambush between Bethel and Hai, on the west side of the same city:


<a id="org039175f"></a>

## Joshua 8:13

But all the rest of the army went in battle array on the north side, so that the last of that multitude reached to the west side of the city. So Joshua went that night, and stood in the midst of the valley.


<a id="org701adb8"></a>

## Joshua 8:14

And when the king of Hai saw this, he made haste in the morning, and went out with all the army of the city, and set it in battle array, toward the desert, not knowing that there lay an ambush behind his back.


<a id="org7ebe9fd"></a>

## Joshua 8:15

But Joshua, and all Israel gave back, making as if they were afraid, and fleeing by the way of the wilderness.


<a id="orgde057a9"></a>

## Joshua 8:16

But they shouting together, and encouraging one another, pursued them. And when they were come from the city,


<a id="orgee95b8e"></a>

## Joshua 8:17

And not one remained in the city of Hai and of Bethel, that did not pursue after Israel, leaving the towns open as they had rushed out,


<a id="orgde801c2"></a>

## Joshua 8:18

The Lord said to Joshua: Lift up the shield that is in thy hand, towards the city of Hai, for I will deliver it to thee.


<a id="org69c59e9"></a>

## Joshua 8:19

And when he had lifted up his shield towards the city, the ambush, that lay hid, rose up immediately: and going to the city, took it, and set it on fire.


<a id="org86bbdb4"></a>

## Joshua 8:20

And the men of the city, that pursued after Joshua, looking back, and seeing the smoke of the city rise up to heaven, had no more power to flee this way or that way: especially as they that had counterfeited flight, and were going toward the wilderness, turned back most valiantly against them that pursued.


<a id="org514e3fa"></a>

## Joshua 8:21

So Joshua, and all Israel, seeing that the city was taken, and that the smoke of the city rose up, returned, and slew the men of Hai.


<a id="org7815701"></a>

## Joshua 8:22

And they also that had taken and set the city on fire, issuing out of the city to meet their own men, began to cut off the enemies who were surrounded by them. So that the enemies being cut off on both sides, not one of so great a multitude was saved.


<a id="orgc0e402d"></a>

## Joshua 8:23

And they took the king of the city of Hai alive and brought him to Joshua.


<a id="org0cbca40"></a>

## Joshua 8:24

So all being slain that had pursued after Israel, in his flight to the wilderness, and falling by the sword in the same place, the children of Israel returned and laid waste the city.


<a id="org0c39318"></a>

## Joshua 8:25

And the number of them that fell that day, both of men and women, was twelve thousand persons, all of the city of Hai.


<a id="org5f2f412"></a>

## Joshua 8:26

But Joshua drew not back his hand, which he had stretched out on high, holding the shield, till all the inhabitants of Hai were slain.


<a id="orge0870dc"></a>

## Joshua 8:27

And the children of Israel divided among them, the cattle and the prey of the city, as the Lord had commanded Joshua.


<a id="orgcb18ef2"></a>

## Joshua 8:28

And he burnt the city, and made it a heap forever:


<a id="orgd0dd8de"></a>

## Joshua 8:29

And he hung the king thereof on a gibbet, until the evening and the going down of the sun. Then Joshua commanded, and they took down his carcass from the gibbet: and threw it in the very entrance of the city, heaping upon it a great heap of stones, which remaineth until this present day.


<a id="orgbd6d971"></a>

## Joshua 8:30

Then Joshua built an altar to the Lord, the God of Israel, in Mount Hebal,


<a id="org1c4b8dd"></a>

## Joshua 8:31

As Moses, the servant of the Lord, had commanded the children of Israel, and it is written in the book of the law of Moses: an altar of unhewn stones, which iron had not touched: and he offered upon it holocausts to the Lord, and immolated victims of peace offerings.


<a id="orgfb6f159"></a>

## Joshua 8:32

And he wrote upon stones, the Deuteronomy of the law of Moses, which he had ordered before the children of Israel.


<a id="org132a12b"></a>

## Joshua 8:33

And all the people, and the ancients, and the princes, and judges, stood on both sides of the ark, before the priests that carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord, both the stranger and he that was born among them, half of them by Mount Garizim, and half by Mount Hebal, as Moses the servant of the Lord, had commanded. And first he blessed the people of Israel.


<a id="orga4bffa9"></a>

## Joshua 8:34

After this, he read all the words of the blessing and the cursing, and all things that were written in the book of the law.


<a id="org4757a48"></a>

## Joshua 8:35

He left out nothing of those things which Moses had commanded, but he repeated all before all the people of Israel, with the women and children, and strangers, that dwelt among them. 


<a id="org11bb084"></a>

# Joshua 9


<a id="org063d1ff"></a>

## Joshua 9:1

Now when these things were heard of, all the kings beyond the Jordan, that dwelt in the mountains, and in the plains, in the places near the sea, and on the coasts of the great sea, they also that dwell by Libanus, the Hethite, and the Amorrhite, the Chanaanite, the Pherezite, and the Hevite, and the Jebusite,


<a id="org5cc1072"></a>

## Joshua 9:2

Gathered themselves together, to fight against Joshua and Israel with one mind, and one resolution.


<a id="org3ab1f8f"></a>

## Joshua 9:3

But they that dwelt in Gabaon, hearing all that Joshua had done to Jericho and Hai:


<a id="org64324e4"></a>

## Joshua 9:4

Cunningly devising took for themselves provisions, laying old sacks upon their asses, and wine bottles rent and sewed up again,


<a id="org174f0a4"></a>

## Joshua 9:5

And very old shoes, which for a show of age were clouted with patches, and old garments upon them: the loaves also, which they carried for provisions by the way, were hard, and broken into pieces:


<a id="org3ba672c"></a>

## Joshua 9:6

And they went to Joshua, who then abode in the camp at Galgal, and said to him, and to all Israel with him: We are come from a far country, desiring to make peace with you. And the children of Israel answered them, and said:


<a id="orgf5aaba7"></a>

## Joshua 9:7

Perhaps you dwell in the land which falls to our lot; if so, we can make no league with you.


<a id="org7d5c5b1"></a>

## Joshua 9:8

But they said to Joshua: We are thy servants. Joshua said to them: Who are you? and whence came you?


<a id="org18f5763"></a>

## Joshua 9:9

They answered: From a very far country thy servants are come in the name of the Lord thy God. For we have heard the fame of his power, all the things that he did in Egypt.


<a id="orgd4af345"></a>

## Joshua 9:10

And to the two kings of the Amorrhites, that were beyond the Jordan, Sehon, king of Hesebon, and Og, king of Basan, that was in Astaroth:


<a id="org1292509"></a>

## Joshua 9:11

And our ancients, and all the inhabitants of our country, said to us: Take with you victuals for a long way, and go meet them, and say: We are your servants, make ye a league with us.


<a id="org76f727f"></a>

## Joshua 9:12

Behold, these loaves we took hot, when we set out from our houses to come to you, now they are become dry, and broken in pieces by being exceeding old.


<a id="org3a99769"></a>

## Joshua 9:13

These bottles of wine when we filled them were new, now they are rent and burst. These garments we have on, and the shoes we have on our feet, by reason of the very long journey, are worn out, and almost consumed.


<a id="org4918e71"></a>

## Joshua 9:14

They took therefore of their victuals, and consulted not the mouth of the Lord.


<a id="org743c25d"></a>

## Joshua 9:15

And Joshua made peace with them, and entering into a league, promised that they should not be slain: the princes also of the multitude swore to them.


<a id="org72ba955"></a>

## Joshua 9:16

Now three days after the league was made, they heard that they dwelt nigh, and they should be among them.


<a id="org5a62943"></a>

## Joshua 9:17

And the children of Israel removed the camp, and came into their cities on the third day, the names of which are, Gabaon, and Caphira, and Beroth, and Cariathiarim.


<a id="orga85606b"></a>

## Joshua 9:18

And they slew them not, because the princes of the multitude had sworn in the name of the Lord, the God of Israel. Then all the common people murmured against the princes.


<a id="org476c157"></a>

## Joshua 9:19

And they answered them: We have sworn to them in the name of the Lord, the God of Israel, and therefore we may not touch them.


<a id="orgf73fcc5"></a>

## Joshua 9:20

But this we will do to them: Let their lives be saved, lest the wrath of the Lord be stirred up against us, if we should be forsworn:


<a id="orga4c06f4"></a>

## Joshua 9:21

But so let them live, as to serve the whole multitude in hewing wood, and bringing in water. As they were speaking these things,


<a id="org38f93c4"></a>

## Joshua 9:22

Josue called the Gabaonites and said to them: Why would you impose upon us, saying: We dwell far off from you, whereas you are in the midst of us?


<a id="orgbd0a3ba"></a>

## Joshua 9:23

Therefore you shall be under a curse, and your race shall always be hewers of wood, and carriers of water, into the house of my God.


<a id="org7276888"></a>

## Joshua 9:24

They answered: It was told us, thy servants, that the Lord thy God had promised his servant Moses, to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants thereof. Therefore we feared exceedingly and provided for our lives, compelled by the dread we had of you, and we took this counsel.


<a id="org03b9ddb"></a>

## Joshua 9:25

And now we are in thy hand: deal with us as it seemeth good and right unto thee.


<a id="orgc83dc21"></a>

## Joshua 9:26

So Joshua did as he had said, and delivered them from the hand of the children of Israel, that they should not be slain.


<a id="org8059f69"></a>

## Joshua 9:27

And he gave orders in that day, that they should be in the service of all the people, and of the altar of the Lord, hewing wood, and carrying water, until this present time, in the place which the Lord hath chosen. 


<a id="orgcb78b7d"></a>

# Joshua 10


<a id="org416dedc"></a>

## Joshua 10:1

When Adonisedec, king of Jerusalem, had heard these things, to wit, that Joshua had taken Hai, and had destroyed it, (for as he had done to Jericho and the king thereof, so did he to Hai and its king) and that the Gabaonites were gone over to Israel, and were their confederates,


<a id="org56f4ab2"></a>

## Joshua 10:2

He was exceedingly afraid. For Gabaon was a great city, and one of the royal cities, and greater than the town of Hai, and all its fighting men were most valiant.


<a id="org9be4a7d"></a>

## Joshua 10:3

Therefore Adonisedec, king of Jerusalem, sent to Oham, king of Hebron, and to Pharam, king of Jerimoth, and to Japhia, king of Lachis, and to Dabir, king of Eglon, saying:


<a id="org1928198"></a>

## Joshua 10:4

Come up to me, and bring help, that we may take Gabaon, because it hath gone over to Joshua, and to the children of Israel.


<a id="orgbe07823"></a>

## Joshua 10:5

So the five kings of the Amorrhites being assembled together, went up: the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jerimoth, the king of Lachis, the king of Eglon, they and their armies, and camped about Gabaon, laying siege to it.


<a id="org5597c6a"></a>

## Joshua 10:6

But the inhabitants of the city of Gabaon, which was besieged, sent to Joshua, who then abode in the camp at Galgal, and said to him: Withdraw not thy hands from helping thy servants: come up quickly, and save us, and bring us succour: for all the kings of the Amorrhites, who dwell in the mountains, are gathered together against us.


<a id="orgfd225f2"></a>

## Joshua 10:7

And Joshua went up from Galgal, and all the army of the warriors with him, most valiant men.


<a id="org55bee7d"></a>

## Joshua 10:8

But the Lord said to Joshua: Fear them not: for I have delivered them into thy hands: none of them shall be able to stand against thee.


<a id="orgfbc0929"></a>

## Joshua 10:9

So Joshua going up from Galgal all the night, came upon them suddenly.


<a id="org695bfb7"></a>

## Joshua 10:10

And the Lord troubled them, at the sight of Israel: and he slew them with a great slaughter, in Gabaon, and pursued them by the way of the ascent to Bethoron, and cut them off all the way to Azeca and Maceda.


<a id="org9e84d03"></a>

## Joshua 10:11

And when they were fleeing from the children of Israel, and were in the descent of Bethoron, the Lord cast down upon them great stones from heaven, as far as Azeca: and many more were killed with the hailstones, than were slain by the swords of the children of Israel,


<a id="org54a11d3"></a>

## Joshua 10:12

Then Joshua spoke to the Lord, in the day that he delivered the Amorrhite in the sight of the children of Israel, and he said before them: Move not, O sun, toward Gabaon, nor thou, O moon, toward the valley of Ajalon.


<a id="org1f0791b"></a>

## Joshua 10:13

And the sun and the moon stood still, till the people revenged themselves of their enemies. Is not this written in the book of the just? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down the space of one day.


<a id="orga3653d1"></a>

## Joshua 10:14

There was not before, nor after, so long a day, the Lord obeying the voice of a man, and fighting for Israel.


<a id="org77248e4"></a>

## Joshua 10:15

And Joshua returned, with all Israel, into the camp of Galgal.


<a id="org7040ed2"></a>

## Joshua 10:16

For the five kings were fled, and had hid themselves in a cave of the city of Maceda.


<a id="org89d664c"></a>

## Joshua 10:17

And it was told Joshua, that the five kings were found hid in a cave of the city of Maceda.


<a id="orge5dad70"></a>

## Joshua 10:18

And he commanded them that were with him, saying: Roll great stones to the mouth of the cave, and set careful men to keep them shut up:


<a id="org1ea6f03"></a>

## Joshua 10:19

And stay you not, but pursue after the enemies, and kill all the hindermost of them as they flee, and do not suffer them whom the Lord God hath delivered into your hands, to shelter themselves in their cities.


<a id="org9cb00ae"></a>

## Joshua 10:20

So the enemies being slain with a great slaughter, and almost utterly consumed, they that were able to escape from Israel, entered into fenced cities.


<a id="org93e869c"></a>

## Joshua 10:21

And all the army returned to Joshua, in Maceda, where the camp then was, in good health, and without the loss of any one: and no man durst move his tongue against the children of Israel.


<a id="org087d3f5"></a>

## Joshua 10:22

And Joshua gave orders, saying: Open the mouth of the cave, and bring forth to me the five kings that lie hid therein.


<a id="org7233315"></a>

## Joshua 10:23

And the ministers did as they were commanded: and they brought out to him the five kings out of the cave: the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jerimoth, the king of Lachis, the king of Eglon.


<a id="orgab6cbff"></a>

## Joshua 10:24

And when they were brought out to him, he called all the men of Israel, and said to the chiefs of the army that were with him: Go, and set your feet on the necks of these kings. And when they had gone, and put their feet upon the necks of them lying under them,


<a id="orgaa01ca6"></a>

## Joshua 10:25

He said again to them: Fear not, neither be ye dismayed, take courage, and be strong: for so will the Lord do to all your enemies, against whom you fight.


<a id="orgc7d2477"></a>

## Joshua 10:26

And Joshua struck, and slew them, and hanged them upon five gibbets; and they hung until the evening.


<a id="orgcbb0aba"></a>

## Joshua 10:27

And when the sun was down, he commanded the soldiers to take them down from the gibbets. And after they were taken down, they cast them into the cave, where they had lain hid, and put great stones at the mouth thereof, which remain until this day.


<a id="org4c8463a"></a>

## Joshua 10:28

The same day Joshua took Maceda, and destroyed it with the edge of the sword, and killed the king and all the inhabitants thereof: he left not in it the least remains. And he did to the king of Maceda, as he had done to the king of Jericho.


<a id="org3ba7bf7"></a>

## Joshua 10:29

And he passed from Maceda with all Israel to Lebna, and fought against it:


<a id="orgdfc2291"></a>

## Joshua 10:30

And the Lord delivered it with the king thereof into the hands of Israel: and they destroyed the city with the edge of the sword, and all the inhabitants thereof. They left not in it any remains. And they did to the king of Lebna, as they had done to the king of Jericho.

## Joshua 10:31

From Lebna he passed unto Lachis, with all Israel: and investing it with his army, besieged it.


<a id="org3458898"></a>

## Joshua 10:32

And the Lord delivered Lachis into the hands of Israel, and he took it the following day, and put it to the sword, and every soul that was in it, as he had done to Lebna.


<a id="orgc7f219c"></a>

## Joshua 10:33

At that time Horam, king of Gazer, came up to succour Lachis: and Joshua slew him with all his people so as to leave none alive.


<a id="orgdfc740e"></a>

## Joshua 10:34

And he passed from Lachis to Eglon, and surrounded it,


<a id="org25631b0"></a>

## Joshua 10:35

And took it the same day: and put to the sword all the souls that were in it, according to all that he had done to Lachis.


<a id="orge5d13ec"></a>

## Joshua 10:36

He went up also with all Israel from Eglon to Hebron, and fought against it:


<a id="orgeff50b7"></a>

## Joshua 10:37

Took it, and destroyed it with the edge of the sword: the king also thereof, and all the towns of that country, and all the souls that dwelt in it: he left not therein any remains: as he had done to Eglon, so did he also to Hebron, putting to the sword all that he found in it.


<a id="orgb55c069"></a>

## Joshua 10:38

Returning from thence to Dabir,


<a id="org215db98"></a>

## Joshua 10:39

He took it, and destroyed it: the king also thereof, and all the towns round about, he destroyed with the edge of the sword: he left not in it any remains: as he had done to Hebron and Lebna, and to their kings, so did he to Dabir, and to the king thereof.


<a id="org04b53b5"></a>

## Joshua 10:40

So Joshua conquered all the country of the hills, and of the south, and of the plain, and of Asedoth, with their kings: he left not any remains therein, but slew all that breathed, as the Lord, the God of Israel, had commanded him.


<a id="org7b1429b"></a>

## Joshua 10:41

From Cadesbarne even to Gaza. All the land of Gosen even to Gabaon,


<a id="org6bb6fdd"></a>

## Joshua 10:42

And all their kings, and their lands he took and wasted at one onset: for the Lord the God of Israel fought for him.


<a id="orgdfb0a2b"></a>

## Joshua 10:43

And he returned with all Israel to the place of the camp in Galgal. 


<a id="orgde1e994"></a>

# Joshua 11


<a id="orgc151a79"></a>

## Joshua 11:1

<a id="orgdf2e5fd"></a>

## Joshua 11:2

And to the kings of the north, that dwelt in the mountains and in the plains over against the south side of Ceneroth, and in the levels and the countries of Dor by the sea side:

## Joshua 11:3

To the Chanaanites also on the east and on the west, and the Amorrhite, and the Hethite, and the Pherezite, and the Jebusite in the mountains: to the Hevite also who dwelt at the foot of Hermon in the land of Maspha.


<a id="org6addfd7"></a>

## Joshua 11:4

And they all came out with their troops, a people exceeding numerous as the sand that is on the sea shore, their horses also and chariots a very great multitude,


<a id="org6f03aac"></a>

## Joshua 11:5

And all these kings assembled together at the waters of Merom, to fight against Israel.


<a id="org8d3fb11"></a>

## Joshua 11:6

And the Lord said to Joshua: Fear them not: for to morrow at this same hour I will deliver all these to be slain in the sight of Israel: thou shalt hamstring their horses, and thou shalt burn their chariots with fire.


<a id="orgf7e662a"></a>

## Joshua 11:7

And Joshua came, and all the army with him, against them to the waters of Merom on a sudden, and fell upon them.


<a id="orgf010788"></a>

## Joshua 11:8

And the Lord delivered them into the hands of Israel. And they defeated them, and chased them as far as the great Sidon and the waters of Maserophot, and the field of Masphe, which is on the east thereof. He slew them all, so as to leave no remains of them:


<a id="org478a7bc"></a>

## Joshua 11:9

And he did as the Lord had commanded him, he hamstringed their horses and burned their chariots.


<a id="org9532e2f"></a>

## Joshua 11:10

And presently turning back he took Asor: and slew the king thereof with the sword. Now Asor of old was the head of all these kingdoms.


<a id="org24c46f2"></a>

## Joshua 11:11

And he cut off all the souls that abode there: he left not in it any remains, but utterly destroyed all, and burned the city itself with fire.


<a id="orge032e52"></a>

## Joshua 11:12

And he took and put to the sword and destroyed all the cities round about, and their kings, as Moses the servant of God had commanded him.


<a id="orgd305d95"></a>

## Joshua 11:13

Except the cities that were on hills and high places, the rest Israel burned: only Asor that was very strong he consumed with fire.


<a id="orgccc7310"></a>

## Joshua 11:14

And the children of Israel divided among themselves all the spoil of these cities and the cattle, killing all the men.


<a id="org37b712c"></a>

## Joshua 11:15

As the Lord had commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command Joshua, and he accomplished all: he left not one thing undone of all the commandments which the Lord had commanded Moses.


<a id="org18c3737"></a>

## Joshua 11:16

So Joshua took all the country of the hills, and of the south, and the land of Gosen, and the plains and the west country, and the mountain of Israel, and the plains thereof:


<a id="org35dcd1a"></a>

## Joshua 11:17

And part of the mountain that goeth up to Seir as far as Baalgad, by the plain of Libanus under mount Hermon: all their kings he took, smote and slew.

## Joshua 11:18

Joshua made war a long time against these kings.


<a id="org31f88e0"></a>

## Joshua 11:19

There was not a city that delivered itself to the children of Israel, except the Hevite, who dwelt in Gabaon: for he took all by fight.


<a id="org99f12cc"></a>

## Joshua 11:20

For it was the sentence of the Lord, that their hearts should be hardened, and they should fight against Israel, and fall, and should not deserve any clemency, and should be destroyed as the Lord had commanded Moses.


<a id="org1f5d22e"></a>

## Joshua 11:21

At that time Joshua came and cut off the Enancims from the mountains, from Hebron, and Dabir, and Anab, and from all the mountain of Juda and Israel, and destroyed their cities.


<a id="orge591a78"></a>

## Joshua 11:22

<a id="orgcc4ce41"></a>

## Joshua 11:23

## Joshua 14:1

For to two tribes and a half Moses had given possession beyond the Jordan: besides the Levites, who received no land among their brethren:


<a id="orgb8e74b9"></a>

## Joshua 14:4

But in their place succeeded the children of Joseph divided into two tribes, of Manasses and Ephraim: neither did the Levites receive other portion of land, but cities to dwell in, and their suburbs to feed their beasts and flocks.

## Joshua 14:5

As the Lord had commanded Moses so did the children of Israel, and they divided the land.


<a id="org226ba6e"></a>

## Joshua 14:7

I was forty years old when Moses the servant of the Lord sent me from Cadesbarne, to view the land, and I brought him word again as to me seemed true,


<a id="org5c2d124"></a>

## Joshua 14:8

But my brethren, that had gone up with me, discouraged the heart of the people: and I nevertheless followed the Lord my God.

Give me therefore this mountain, which the Lord promised, in thy hearing also, wherein are the Enacims, and cities great and strong: if so be the Lord will be with me, and I shall be able to destroy them, as he promised me.

And it passeth on from the top of the mountain to the fountain of the water of Nephtoa: and reacheth to the towns of mount Ephron: and it bendeth towards Baala, which is Cariathiarim, that is to say, the city of the woods.


<a id="org14c93f6"></a>

## Joshua 15:10

And it compasseth from Baala westward unto mount Seir: and passeth by the side of mount Jarim to the north into Cheslon: and goeth down into Bethsames, and passeth into Thamna.

And Caleb said: He that shall smite Cariath-Sepher, and take it, I will give him Axa my daughter to wife.

## Joshua 17:15

And Joshua said to them: If thou be a great people, go up into the woodland, and cut down room for thyself in the land of the Pherezite and the Raphaims: because the possession of mount Ephraim is too narrow for thee.


<a id="orgc3558b1"></a>

## Joshua 17:16

And the children of Joseph answered him: We cannot go up to the mountains, for the Chanaanites that dwell in the low lands, wherein are situate Bethsan with its towns, and Jezrael in the midst of the valley, have chariots of iron.

And Joshua said to the house of Joseph, to Ephraim and Manasses: Thou art a great people, and of great strength, thou shalt not have one lot only:

<a id="org4d7fa36"></a>

## Joshua 22:16

Thus saith all the people of the Lord: What meaneth this transgression? Why have you forsaken the Lord the God of Israel, building a sacrilegious altar, and revolting from the worship of him?


<a id="orgba30741"></a>

## Joshua 22:17

Is it a small thing to you that you sinned with Beelphegor, and the stain of that crime remaineth in us to this day? and many of the people perished.


<a id="orgf0e37f9"></a>

## Joshua 22:18

And you have forsaken the Lord to day, and to morrow his wrath will rage against all Israel.


<a id="orgc15dfcf"></a>

## Joshua 22:19

But if you think the land of your possession to be unclean, pass over to the land wherein is the tabernacle of the Lord, and dwell among us: only depart not from the Lord, and from our society, by building an altar beside the altar of the Lord our God.


<a id="orgb2e10ce"></a>

## Joshua 22:20

## Joshua 22:21

And the children of Ruben, and of Gad, and of the half tribe of Manasses answered the princes of the embassage of Israel:


<a id="org6ca7838"></a>

## Joshua 22:22

The Lord the most mighty God, the Lord the most mighty God, he knoweth, and Israel also shall understand: If with the design of transgression we have set up this altar, let him not save us, but punish us immediately:


<a id="orgeffbd67"></a>

## Joshua 22:23

And if we did it with that mind, that we might lay upon it holocausts, and sacrifice, and victims of peace offerings, let him require and judge:


<a id="org532b68f"></a>

## Joshua 22:24

And not rather with this thought and design, that we should say: To morrow your children will say to our children: What have you to do with the Lord the God of Israel?


<a id="org23f691f"></a>

## Joshua 22:25

The Lord hath put the river Jordan for a border between us and you, O ye children of Ruben, and ye children of Gad: and therefore you have no part in the Lord. And by this occasion your children shall turn away our children from the fear of the Lord. We therefore thought it best,


<a id="org56aa260"></a>

## Joshua 22:26

And said: Let us build us an altar, not for holocausts, nor to offer victims,


<a id="orgd82918e"></a>

## Joshua 22:27

But for a testimony between us and you, and our posterity and yours, that we may serve the Lord, and that we may have a right to offer both holocausts, and victims and sacrifices of peace offerings: and that your children to morrow may not say to our children: You have no part in the Lord.


<a id="org5df766d"></a>

## Joshua 22:28

And if they will say so, they shall answer them: Behold the altar of the Lord, which our fathers made, not for holocausts, nor for sacrifice, but for a testimony between us and you.


<a id="orgd419ba9"></a>

## Joshua 22:29

God keep us from any such wickedness that we should revolt from the Lord, and leave off following his steps, by building an altar to offer holocausts, and sacrifices, and victims, beside the altar of the Lord our God, which is erected before his tabernacle.


<a id="orga4f6627"></a>

## Joshua 22:30

And when Phinees the priest, and the princes of the embassage, who were with him, had heard this, they were satisfied: and they admitted most willingly the words of the children of Ruben, and Gad, and of the half tribe of Manasses,


<a id="orga9a71d7"></a>

## Joshua 22:31

And Phinees the priest the son of Eleazar said to them: Now we know that the Lord is with us, because you are not guilty of this revolt, and you have delivered the children of Israel from the hand of the Lord.


<a id="org5256908"></a>

## Joshua 22:32

And he returned with the princes from the children of Ruben and Gad, out of the land of Galaad, into the land of Chanaan, to the children of Israel, and brought them word again.


<a id="orgcc3226a"></a>

## Joshua 22:33
