## Jeremiah 38:9

My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done against Jeremiah the prophet, casting him into the dungeon to die there with hunger, for there is no more bread in the city.


<a id="org813e30e"></a>

## Jeremiah 38:10

## Jeremiah 38:15

Then Jeremiah said to Sedecias: If I shall declare it to thee, wilt thou not put me to death? and if I give thee counsel, thou wilt not hearken to me.


<a id="orgfd970fc"></a>

## Jeremiah 38:16

Then king Sedecias swore to Jeremiah, in private, saying: As the Lord liveth, that, made us this soul, I will not put thee to death, nor will I deliver thee into the hands of these men that seek thy life.


<a id="org8f973bb"></a>

## Jeremiah 38:17

And Jeremiah said to Sedecias: Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: If thou wilt take a resolution and go out to the princes of the king of Babylon, thy soul shall live, and this city shall not be burnt with fire: and thou shalt be safe, and thy house.


<a id="orgc343820"></a>

## Jeremiah 38:18

But if thou wilt not go out to the princes of the king of Babylon, this city shall be delivered into the hands of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire: and thou shalt not escape out of their hand.

## Jeremiah 38:20

But Jeremiah answered: They shall not deliver thee: hearken, I beseech thee, to the word of the Lord, which I speak to the, and it shall be well with thee, and thy soul shall live.


<a id="orgd7f5d2c"></a>

## Jeremiah 38:21

But if thou wilt not go forth, this is the word which the Lord hath shewn me:


<a id="org42113c9"></a>

## Jeremiah 38:22

Behold all the women that are left in the house of the king of Juda, shall be brought out to the princes of the king of Babylon: and they shall say: Thy men of peace have deceived thee, and have prevailed against thee, they have plunged thy feet in the mire, and in a slippery place and they have departed from thee.


<a id="orgfc5f665"></a>

## Jeremiah 38:23

And all thy wives, and thy children shall be brought out to the Chaldeans, and thou shalt not escape their hands, but thou shalt be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon: and he shall burn this city with fire.


<a id="orgcf7e6ca"></a>

## Jeremiah 38:24

Then Sedecias said to Jeremiah: Let no man know these words, and thou shalt not die.


<a id="org4209be9"></a>

## Jeremiah 38:25

But if the princes shall hear that I have spoken with thee, and shall come to thee, and say to thee: Tell us what thou hast said to the king, hide it not from us, and we will not kill thee: and also what the king said to thee:


<a id="org373fdf4"></a>
