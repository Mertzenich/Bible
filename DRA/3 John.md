# III John 1


<a id="org10a6bfb"></a>

## III John 1:1

The Ancient, to the dearly beloved Gaius, whom I love in truth.


<a id="org80e07e1"></a>

## III John 1:2

Dearly beloved, concerning all things I make it my prayer that thou mayest proceed prosperously and fare well, as thy soul doth prosperously.


<a id="org850da83"></a>

## III John 1:3

I was exceedingly glad when the brethren came and gave testimony to the truth in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth.


<a id="orgd10712b"></a>

## III John 1:4

I have no greater grace than this, to hear that my children walk in truth.


<a id="orga245b1b"></a>

## III John 1:5

Dearly beloved, thou dost faithfully whatever thou dost for the brethren: and that for strangers,


<a id="org5d056fa"></a>

## III John 1:6

Who have given testimony to thy charity in the sight of the church. Whom thou shalt do well to bring forward on their way in a manner worthy of God:


<a id="org6ef3f26"></a>

## III John 1:7

Because, for his name they went out, taking nothing of the Gentiles.


<a id="org91a6ae5"></a>

## III John 1:8

We therefore ought to receive such: that we may be fellow helpers of the truth.


<a id="org2880398"></a>

## III John 1:9

I had written perhaps to the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, doth not receive us.


<a id="org01bb089"></a>

## III John 1:10

For this cause, if I come, I will advertise his works which he doth; with malicious words prating against us. And as if these things were not enough for him, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and them that do receive them he forbiddeth, and casteth out of the church.


<a id="orgf066705"></a>

## III John 1:11

Dearly beloved, follow not that which is evil: but that which is good. He that doth good is of God: he that doth evil hath not seen God.


<a id="org659f6ef"></a>

## III John 1:12

To Demetrius, testimony is given by all, and by the truth itself: yea and we also give testimony. And thou knowest that our testimony is true.


<a id="orge45b949"></a>

## III John 1:13

I had many things to write unto thee: but I would not by ink and pen write to thee.


<a id="orga16a768"></a>

## III John 1:14

But I hope speedily to see thee: and we will speak mouth to mouth. Peace be to thee. Our friends salute thee. Salute the friends by name.
