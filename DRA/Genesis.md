## Genesis 19:8

I have two daughters who, as yet, have not known man; I will bring them out to you, and abuse you them as it shall please you, so that you do no evil to these men, because they are come in under the shadow of my roof.


<a id="org12914d1"></a>

## Genesis 19:9

But they said: Get thee back thither. And again: Thou camest in, said they, as a stranger, was it to be a judge? therefore we will afflict thee more than them. And they pressed very violently upon Lot: and they were even at the point of breaking open the doors.


<a id="org912d7f8"></a>

## Genesis 19:10

And behold the men put out their hand, and drew in Lot unto them, and shut the door.


<a id="org23c2f9a"></a>

## Genesis 19:11

And them, that were without, they struck with blindness from the least to the greatest, so that they could not find the door.


<a id="org4b9e6ff"></a>

## Genesis 19:12

And they said to Lot: Hast thou here any of thine? son in law, or sons, or daughters, all that are thine bring them out of this city:


<a id="org07f4018"></a>

## Genesis 19:13

For we will destroy this place, because their cry is grown loud before the Lord, who hath sent us to destroy them.


<a id="orgcac1113"></a>

## Genesis 19:14

So Lot went out, and spoke to his sons in law that were to have his daughters, and said: Arise: get you out of this place, because the Lord will destroy this city. And he seemed to them to speak as it were in jest.


<a id="org5b5ba68"></a>

## Genesis 19:15

And when it was morning, the angels pressed him, saying: Arise, take thy wife, and the two daughters that thou hast: lest thou also perish in the wickedness of the city.


<a id="org88424b1"></a>

## Genesis 19:16

And as he lingered, they took his hand, and the hand of his wife, and of his two daughters, because the Lord spared him.


<a id="org611083e"></a>

## Genesis 19:17

And they brought him forth, and set him without the city: and there they spoke to him, saying: Save thy life: look not back, neither stay thou in all the country about: but save thy self in the mountain, lest thou be also consumed.


<a id="org6bdbd65"></a>

## Genesis 19:18

And Lot said to them: I beseech thee, my Lord,


<a id="orgc6ad9c8"></a>

## Genesis 19:19

Because thy servant hath found grace before thee, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewn to me, in saving my life, and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil seize me, and I die.


<a id="org8c2ad70"></a>

## Genesis 19:20

There is this city here at hand, to which I may flee, it is a little one, and I shall be saved in it: is it not a little one, and my soul shall live?


<a id="org12d6c2e"></a>

## Genesis 19:21

And he said to him: Behold also in this, I have heard thy prayers, not to destroy the city for which thou hast spoken.


<a id="org399d8ca"></a>

## Genesis 19:22

Make haste, and be saved there: because I cannot do any thing till thou go in thither. Therefore the name of that city was called Segor.


<a id="org13351e7"></a>

## Genesis 19:23

The sun was risen upon the earth, and Lot entered into Segor.


<a id="orgd40c9d1"></a>

## Genesis 19:24

And the Lord rained upon Sodom and Gomorrha brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven.


<a id="orgaead6f2"></a>

## Genesis 19:25

And he destroyed these cities, and all the country about, all the inhabitants of the cities, and all things that spring from the earth.


<a id="orgf0321ce"></a>

## Genesis 19:26

And his wife looking behind her, was turned into a statue of salt.


<a id="org71295a5"></a>

## Genesis 19:27

And Abraham got up early in the morning, and in the place where he had stood before with the Lord:


<a id="org1a9740e"></a>

## Genesis 19:28

He looked towards Sodom and Gomorrha, and the whole land of that country: and he saw the ashes rise up from the earth as the smoke of a furnace.


<a id="orgdf82019"></a>

## Genesis 19:29

Now when God destroyed the cities of that country, remembering Abraham, he delivered Lot out of the destruction of the cities wherein he had dwelt.


<a id="org144d214"></a>

## Genesis 19:30

And Lot went up out of Segor, and abode in the mountain, and his two daughters with him (for he was afraid to stay in Segor) and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters with him.


<a id="orgd0241c1"></a>

## Genesis 19:31

And the elder said to the younger: Our father is old, and there is no man left on the earth, to come in unto us after the manner of the whole earth.


<a id="orgd17a23b"></a>

## Genesis 19:32

Come, let us make him drunk with wine, and let us lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.


<a id="org060478b"></a>

## Genesis 19:33

And they made their father drink wine that night: and the elder went in, and lay with her father: but he perceived not, neither when his daughter lay down, nor when she rose up.


<a id="org6a059f9"></a>

## Genesis 19:34

And the next day the elder said to the younger: Behold I lay last night with my father, let us make him drink wine also to night, and thou shalt lie with him, that we may save seed of our father.


<a id="org37577ce"></a>

## Genesis 19:35

They made their father drink wine that night also, and the younger daughter went in, and lay with him: and neither then did he perceive when she lay down, nor when she rose up.


<a id="org0f28d57"></a>

## Genesis 19:36

So the two daughters of Lot were with child by their father.


<a id="orgcfd1652"></a>

## Genesis 19:37

And the elder bore a son, and she called his name Moab: he is the father of the Moabites unto this day.


<a id="orge63d46e"></a>

## Genesis 19:38

The younger also bore a son, and she called his name Ammon; that is, the son of my people: he is the father of the Ammonites unto this day.


<a id="org9588bf6"></a>

# Genesis 20


<a id="org15fe4c0"></a>

## Genesis 20:1

Abraham removed from thence to the south country, and dwelt between Cades and Sur, and sojourned in Gerara.


<a id="orgd543eef"></a>

## Genesis 20:2

And he said of Sara his wife: She is my sister. So Abimelech the king of Gerara sent, and took her.


<a id="org179f0c7"></a>

## Genesis 20:3

And God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and he said to him: Lo thou shalt die for the woman that thou hast taken: for she hath a husband.


<a id="orgbe787e2"></a>

## Genesis 20:4

Now Abimelech had not touched her, and he said: Lord, wilt thou slay a nation that is ignorant and just?


<a id="org1f09811"></a>

## Genesis 20:5

Did not he say to me: She is my sister: and she say, He is my brother? in the simplicity of my heart, and cleanness of my hands have I done this.


<a id="org586eabd"></a>

## Genesis 20:6

And God said to him: And I know that thou didst it with a sincere heart: and therefore I withheld thee from sinning against me, and I suffered thee not to touch her.


<a id="org5a27d18"></a>

## Genesis 20:7

Now therefore restore the man his wife, for he is a prophet: and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: but if thou wilt not restore her, know that thou shalt surely die, thou and all that are thine.


<a id="org93260e9"></a>

## Genesis 20:8

And Abimelech forthwith rising up in the night, called all his servants: and spoke all these words in their hearing, and all the men were exceedingly afraid.


<a id="orgaf950c9"></a>

## Genesis 20:9

And Abimelech called also for Abraham, and said to him: What hast thou done to us? what have we offended thee in, that thou hast brought upon me and upon my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done to us what thou oughtest not to do.


<a id="org96d7e5e"></a>

## Genesis 20:10

And again he expostulated with him, and said: What sawest thou, that thou hast done this?


<a id="orgd9d67ab"></a>

## Genesis 20:11

Abraham answered: I thought with myself, saying: Perhaps there is not the fear of God in this place: and they will kill me for the sake of my wife:


<a id="orga78954b"></a>

## Genesis 20:12

Howbeit, otherwise also she is truly my sister, the daughter of my father, and not the daughter of my mother, and I took her to wife.


<a id="org3d60068"></a>

## Genesis 20:13

And after God brought me out of my father&rsquo;s house, I said to her: Thou shalt do me this kindness: In every place, to which we shall come, thou shalt say that I am thy brother.


<a id="orga18de02"></a>

## Genesis 20:14

And Abimelech took sheep and oxen, and servants and handmaids, and gave to Abraham: and restored to him Sara his wife,


<a id="org3a36a87"></a>

## Genesis 20:15

And said: The land is before you, dwell wheresoever it shall please thee.


<a id="orga5733df"></a>

## Genesis 20:16

And to Sara he said: Behold I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver, this shall serve thee for a covering of thy eyes to all that are with thee, and whithersoever thou shalt go: and remember thou wast taken.


<a id="orgfdf210a"></a>

## Genesis 20:17

And when Abraham prayed, God healed Abimelech and his wife, and his handmaids, and they bore children:


<a id="org7f781c6"></a>

## Genesis 20:18

For the Lord had closed up every womb of the house of Abimelech, on account of Sara, Abraham&rsquo;s wife.


<a id="org8ddb3c5"></a>

# Genesis 21


<a id="orgf4d35f3"></a>

## Genesis 21:1

And the Lord visited Sara, as he had promised: and fulfilled what he had spoken.


<a id="orge21d9a1"></a>

## Genesis 21:2

And she conceived and bore a son in her old age, at the time that God had foretold her.


<a id="orgbca19ae"></a>

## Genesis 21:3

And Abraham called the name of his son, whom Sara bore him, Isaac.


<a id="orgf58228f"></a>

## Genesis 21:4

And he circumcised him the eighth day, as God had commanded him,


<a id="org1d68389"></a>

## Genesis 21:5

When he was a hundred years old: for at this age of his father, was Isaac born.


<a id="org9c20f56"></a>

## Genesis 21:6

And Sara said: God hath made a laughter for me: whosoever shall hear of it will laugh with me.


<a id="org2aa2ac3"></a>

## Genesis 21:7

And again she said: Who would believe that Abraham should hear that Sara gave suck to a son, whom she bore to him in his old age?


<a id="orgcd70f77"></a>

## Genesis 21:8

And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast on the day of his weaning.


<a id="org7bfcd56"></a>

## Genesis 21:9

And when Sara had seen the son of Agar, the Egyptian, playing with Isaac, her son, she said to Abraham:


<a id="orgaac160b"></a>

## Genesis 21:10

Cast out this bondwoman and her son; for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with my son Isaac.


<a id="org128dabb"></a>

## Genesis 21:11

Abraham took this grievously for his son.


<a id="org4ef574e"></a>

## Genesis 21:12

And God said to him: Let it not seem grievous to thee for the boy, and for thy bondwoman: in all that Sara hath said to thee, hearken to her voice: for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.


<a id="orgca8e4dc"></a>

## Genesis 21:13

But I will make the son also of the bondwoman a great nation, because he is thy seed.


<a id="org8df09eb"></a>

## Genesis 21:14

So Abraham rose up in the morning, and taking bread and a bottle of water, put it upon her shoulder, and delivered the boy, and sent her away. And she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Bersabee.


<a id="org9adaa98"></a>

## Genesis 21:15

And when the water in the bottle was spent, she cast the boy under one of the trees that were there.


<a id="orgf2abb99"></a>

## Genesis 21:16

And she went her way, and sat over against him a great way off, as far as a bow can carry, for she said: I will not see the boy die: and sitting over against, she lifted up her voice and wept.


<a id="orgbcbfdc3"></a>

## Genesis 21:17

And God heard the voice of the boy: and an angel of God called to Agar from heaven, saying: What art thou doing, Agar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the boy, from the place wherein he is.


<a id="orgae1cc08"></a>

## Genesis 21:18

Arise, take up the boy, and hold him by the hand, for I will make him a great nation.


<a id="org85d7a65"></a>

## Genesis 21:19

And God opened her eyes: and she saw a well of water, and went and filled the bottle, and gave the boy to drink.


<a id="org03c4fc3"></a>

## Genesis 21:20

And God was with him: and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became a young man, an archer.


<a id="orgeb9b85e"></a>

## Genesis 21:21

And he dwelt in the wilderness of Pharan, and his mother took a wife for him out of the land of Egypt.


<a id="org347cc89"></a>

## Genesis 21:22

At the same time Abimelech, and Phicol the general of his army, said to Abraham: God is with thee in all that thou dost.


<a id="org83ff8be"></a>

## Genesis 21:23

Swear therefore by God, that thou wilt not hurt me, nor my posterity, nor my stock: but according to the kindness that I have done to thee, thou shalt do to me, and to the land wherein thou hast lived a stranger.


<a id="org75d7292"></a>

## Genesis 21:24

And Abraham said: I will swear.


<a id="orga2bd092"></a>

## Genesis 21:25

And he reproved Abimelech for a well of water, which his servants had taken away by force.


<a id="org958883f"></a>

## Genesis 21:26

And Abimelech answered: I knew not who did this thing: and thou didst not tell me, and I heard not of it till today.


<a id="org1ade934"></a>

## Genesis 21:27

Then Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them to Abimelech: and both of them made a league.


<a id="org28d528c"></a>

## Genesis 21:28

And Abraham set apart seven ewelambs of the flock.


<a id="orgb584580"></a>

## Genesis 21:29

And Abimelech said to him: What mean these seven ewelambs which thou hast set apart?


<a id="org30bf153"></a>

## Genesis 21:30

But he said: Thou shalt take seven ewelambs at my hand: that they may be a testimony for me, that I dug this well.


<a id="org8616ab4"></a>

## Genesis 21:31

Therefore that place was called Bersabee; because there both of them did swear.


<a id="org74fac6f"></a>

## Genesis 21:32

And they made a league for the well of oath.


<a id="org313afc4"></a>

## Genesis 21:33

And Abimelech and Phicol, the general of his army, arose and returned to the land of the Palestines. But Abraham planted a grove in Bersabee, and there called upon the name of the Lord God eternal.


<a id="org1662fb8"></a>

## Genesis 21:34

And he was a sojourner in the land of the Palestines many days.


<a id="orgc9d1a17"></a>

# Genesis 22


<a id="org75a1c37"></a>

## Genesis 22:1

After these things, God tempted Abraham, and said to him: Abraham, Abraham. And he answered: Here I am.


<a id="orga04800b"></a>

## Genesis 22:2

He said to him: Take thy only begotten son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and go into the land of vision; and there thou shalt offer him for an holocaust upon one of the mountains which I will shew thee.


<a id="orgd167be3"></a>

## Genesis 22:3

So Abraham rising up in the night, saddled his ass, and took with him two young men, and Isaac his son: and when he had cut wood for the holocaust, he went his way to the place which God had commanded him.


<a id="orge32f2b2"></a>

## Genesis 22:4

And on the third day, lifting up his eyes, he saw the place afar off.


<a id="org7b85eb4"></a>

## Genesis 22:5

And he said to his young men: Stay you here with the ass; I and the boy will go with speed as far as yonder, and after we have worshipped, will return to you.


<a id="org4f16a4d"></a>

## Genesis 22:6

And he took the wood for the holocaust, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he himself carried in his hands fire and a sword. And as they two went on together,


<a id="orgb6bac96"></a>

## Genesis 22:7

Isaac said to his father: My father. And he answered: What wilt thou, son? Behold, saith he, fire and wood: where is the victim for the holocaust?


<a id="orgbf21b05"></a>

## Genesis 22:8

And Abraham said: God will provide himself a victim for an holocaust, my son. So they went on together.


<a id="org50754e8"></a>

## Genesis 22:9

And they came to the place which God had shewn him, where he built an altar, and laid the wood in order upon it; and when he had bound Isaac his son, he laid him on the altar upon the pile of wood.


<a id="orgbae3953"></a>

## Genesis 22:10

And he put forth his hand, and took the sword, to sacrifice his son.


<a id="org4efeb87"></a>

## Genesis 22:11

And behold, an angel of the Lord from heaven called to him, saying: Abraham, Abraham. And he answered: Here I am.


<a id="org81375ff"></a>

## Genesis 22:12

And he said to him: Lay not thy hand upon the boy, neither do thou any thing to him: now I know that thou fearest God, and hast not spared thy only begotten son for my sake.


<a id="org52fe1c8"></a>

## Genesis 22:13

Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw behind his back a ram, amongst the briers, sticking fast by the horns, which he took and offered for a holocaust instead of his son.


<a id="org484dd35"></a>

## Genesis 22:14

And he called the name of that place, The Lord seeth. Whereupon, even to this day, it is said: In the mountain the Lord will see.


<a id="orgea544e2"></a>

## Genesis 22:15

And the angel of the Lord called to Abraham a second time from heaven, saying:


<a id="orgcbdf154"></a>

## Genesis 22:16

By my own self have I sworn, saith the Lord: because thou hast done this thing, and hast not spared thy only begotten son for my sake:


<a id="org293b860"></a>

## Genesis 22:17

I will bless thee, and I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand that is by the sea shore; thy seed shall possess the gates of their enemies.


<a id="orgc9c580a"></a>

## Genesis 22:18

And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, because thou hast obeyed my voice.


<a id="org1e2e9f0"></a>

## Genesis 22:19

Abraham returned to his young men, and they went to Bersabee together, and he dwelt there.


<a id="orgfcf373c"></a>

## Genesis 22:20

After these things, it was told Abraham, that Melcha also had borne children to Nachor his brother.


<a id="org6fa0c10"></a>

## Genesis 22:21

Hus, the firstborn, and Buz, his brother, and Camuel the father of the Syrians,

And Cased, and Azau, and Pheldas, and Jedlaph,


<a id="org34c86f1"></a>

## Genesis 23:1

And Sara lived a hundred and twenty-seven years.


<a id="orgc0307ee"></a>

## Genesis 23:2

And she died in the city of Arbee which is Hebron, in the land of Chanaan: and Abraham came to mourn and weep for her.


<a id="org58e0d45"></a>

## Genesis 23:3

And after he rose up from the funeral obsequies, he spoke to the children of Heth, saying:


<a id="org9acadef"></a>

## Genesis 23:4

I am a stranger and sojourner among you: give me the right of a burying place with you, that I may bury my dead.


<a id="orgb2ee413"></a>

## Genesis 23:5

The children of Heth answered, saying:


<a id="orgec5a361"></a>

## Genesis 23:6

My lord, hear us, thou art a prince of God among us: bury thy dead in our principal sepulchres: and no man shall have power to hinder thee from burying thy dead in his sepulchre.


<a id="org0e0595c"></a>

## Genesis 23:7

Abraham rose up, and bowed down to the people of the land, to wit, the children of Heth:


<a id="org24b1e81"></a>

## Genesis 23:8

And said to them: If it please your soul that I should bury my dead, hear me, and intercede for me to Ephron the son of Seor.


<a id="org7505a1c"></a>

## Genesis 23:9

That he may give me the double cave, which he hath in the end of his field: For as much money as it is worth he shall give it me before you, for a possession of a burying place.


<a id="org0fb3bb2"></a>

## Genesis 23:10

Now Ephron dwelt in the midst of the children of Heth. And Ephron made answer to Abraham in the hearing of all that went in at the gate of the city, saying:


<a id="orgf158ebe"></a>

## Genesis 23:11

Let it not be so, my lord, but do thou rather hearken to what I say: The field I deliver to thee, and the cave that is therein; in the presence of the children of my people, bury thy dead.


<a id="orgdf28651"></a>

## Genesis 23:12

Abraham bowed down before the people of the land.


<a id="org285e722"></a>

## Genesis 23:13

And he spoke to Ephron, in the presence of the people: I beseech thee to hear me: I will give money for the field; take it, and so will I bury my dead in it.


<a id="org3e8e2d6"></a>

## Genesis 23:14

And Ephron answered:


<a id="org57ba484"></a>

## Genesis 23:15

My lord, hear me. The ground which thou desirest, is worth four hundred sicles of silver: this is the price between me and thee: but what is this? bury thy dead.


<a id="orge0aaf53"></a>

## Genesis 23:16

And when Abraham had heard this, he weighed out the money that Ephron had asked, in the hearing of the children of Heth, four hundred sicles of silver, of common current money.


<a id="orgf412a6b"></a>

## Genesis 23:17

And the field that before was Ephron&rsquo;s, wherein was the double cave, looking towards Mambre, both it and the cave, and all the trees thereof, in all its limits round about,


<a id="orgdfc5876"></a>

## Genesis 23:18

Was made sure to Abraham for a possession, in the sight of the children of Heth, and of all that went in at the gate of his city.


<a id="orgdef582c"></a>

## Genesis 23:19

And so Abraham buried Sara, his wife, in the double cave of the field, that looked towards Mambre, this is Hebron in the land of Chanaan.


<a id="org5cab2be"></a>

## Genesis 23:20

And the field was made sure to Abraham, and the cave that was in it, for a possession to bury in, by the children of Heth.

# Genesis 24


<a id="org3af63c1"></a>

## Genesis 24:1

Now Abraham was old, and advanced in age; and the Lord had blessed him in all things.


<a id="org4c4b108"></a>

## Genesis 24:2

And he said to the elder servant of his house, who was ruler over all he had: Put thy hand under my thigh,


<a id="orgf26cd81"></a>

## Genesis 24:3

That I may make thee swear by the Lord, the God of heaven and earth, that thou take not a wife for my son, of the daughters of the Chanaanites, among whom I dwell:


<a id="orgcd18d16"></a>

## Genesis 24:4

But that thou go to my own country and kindred, and take a wife from thence for my son Isaac.


<a id="org05ca807"></a>

## Genesis 24:5

The servant answered: If the woman will not come with me into this land, must I bring thy son back again to the place from whence thou camest out?


<a id="org635c98c"></a>

## Genesis 24:6

And Abraham said: Beware thou never bring my son back again thither.


<a id="orga116fa4"></a>

## Genesis 24:7

The Lord God of heaven, who took me out of my father&rsquo;s house, and out of my native country, who spoke to me, and swore to me, saying: To thy seed will I give this land: he will send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take from thence a wife for my son.


<a id="orgcf30b1f"></a>

## Genesis 24:8

But if the woman will not follow thee, thou shalt not be bound by the oath: only bring not my son back thither again.


<a id="orgc31f6d2"></a>

## Genesis 24:9

The servant, therefore, put his hand under the thigh of Abraham, his lord, and swore to him upon his word.


<a id="org46a2e66"></a>

## Genesis 24:10

And he took ten camels of his master&rsquo;s herd, and departed, carrying something of all his goods with him, and he set forward and went on to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nachor.


<a id="org30347ea"></a>

## Genesis 24:11

And when he had made the camels lie down without the town, near a well of water, in the evening, at the time when women are wont to come out to draw water, he said:


<a id="orgc205d89"></a>

## Genesis 24:12

O Lord, the God of my master, Abraham, meet me today, I beseech thee, and shew kindness to my master, Abraham.


<a id="org53e3615"></a>

## Genesis 24:13

Behold, I stand nigh the spring of water, and the daughters of the inhabitants of this city will come out to draw water:


<a id="org4a89af7"></a>

## Genesis 24:14

Now, therefore, the maid to whom I shall say: Let down thy pitcher that I may drink: and she shall answer, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let it be the same whom thou hast provided for thy servant Isaac: and by this, I shall understand that thou hast shewn kindness to my master.


<a id="orgadb5ba3"></a>

## Genesis 24:15

He had not yet ended these words within himself, and behold Rebecca came out, the daughter of Bathuel, son of Melcha, wife to Nachor the brother of Abraham, having a pitcher on her shoulder:


<a id="org60e3c09"></a>

## Genesis 24:16

An exceeding comely maid, and a most beautiful virgin, and not known to man: and she went down to the spring, and filled her pitcher, and was coming back.


<a id="orgc9d3bcb"></a>

## Genesis 24:17

And the servant ran to meet her, and said: Give me a little water to drink of thy pitcher.


<a id="org62211e1"></a>

## Genesis 24:18

And she answered: Drink, my lord. And quickly she let down the pitcher upon her arm, and gave him drink.


<a id="org3a10c32"></a>

## Genesis 24:19

And when he had drunk, she said: I will draw water for thy camels also, till they all drink.


<a id="orgd7780f5"></a>

## Genesis 24:20

And pouring out the pitcher into the troughs, she ran back to the well to draw water; and having drawn, she gave to all the camels.


<a id="orgf93a91e"></a>

## Genesis 24:21

But he musing, beheld her with silence, desirous to know whether the Lord had made his journey prosperous or not.


<a id="orgaccead6"></a>

## Genesis 24:22

And after that the camels had drunk, the man took out golden earrings, weighing two sicles; and as many bracelets, of ten sicles weight.


<a id="org11db4fd"></a>

## Genesis 24:23

And he said to her: Whose daughter art thou? tell me: is there any place in thy father&rsquo;s house to lodge?


<a id="org5359270"></a>

## Genesis 24:24

And she answered: I am the daughter of Bathuel, the son of Melcha, whom she bore to Nachor.


<a id="org6b8d84b"></a>

## Genesis 24:25

And she said, moreover, to him: We have good store of both straw and hay, and a large place to lodge in.


<a id="orgfe22419"></a>

## Genesis 24:26

The man bowed himself down, and adored the Lord,


<a id="org8c99ceb"></a>

## Genesis 24:27

Saying: Blessed be the Lord God of my master Abraham, who hath not taken away his mercy and truth from my master, and hath brought me the straight way into the house of my master&rsquo;s brother.


<a id="org923752c"></a>

## Genesis 24:28

Then the maid ran, and told in her mother&rsquo;s house all that she had heard.


<a id="org1bdbf5a"></a>

## Genesis 24:29

And Rebecca had a brother, named Laban, who went out in haste to the man, to the well.


<a id="org25a7ea7"></a>

## Genesis 24:30

And when he had seen the earrings and bracelets in his sister&rsquo;s hands, and had heard all that she related, saying, Thus and thus the man spoke to me: he came to the man who stood by the camels, and near to the spring of water,


<a id="org11a0469"></a>

## Genesis 24:31

And said to him: Come in, thou blessed of the Lord; why standest thou without? I have prepared the house, and a place for the camels.


<a id="org3abc3e8"></a>

## Genesis 24:32

And he brought him into his lodging; and he unharnessed the camels, and gave straw and hay, and water to wash his feet, and the feet of the men that were come with him.


<a id="org99639a0"></a>

## Genesis 24:33

And bread was set before him. But he said: I will not eat, till I tell my message. He answered him: Speak.


<a id="orgd474aa4"></a>

## Genesis 24:34

And he said: I am the servant of Abraham:


<a id="orgab464ea"></a>

## Genesis 24:35

And the Lord hath blessed my master wonderfully, and he is become great: and he hath given him sheep and oxen, silver and gold, men servants and women servants, camels and asses.


<a id="org185ff86"></a>

## Genesis 24:36

And Sara, my master&rsquo;s wife, hath borne my master a son in her old age, and he hath given him all that he had.


<a id="org41095ad"></a>

## Genesis 24:37

And my master made me swear, saying: Thou shalt not take a wife for my son of the Chanaanites, in whose land I dwell:


<a id="org9ee72e5"></a>

## Genesis 24:38

But thou shalt go to my father&rsquo;s house, and shalt take a wife of my own kindred for my son:


<a id="org8ea3531"></a>

## Genesis 24:39

But I answered my master: What if the woman will not come with me?


<a id="org61a7369"></a>

## Genesis 24:40

The Lord, said he, in whose sight I walk, will send his angel with thee, and will direct thy way: and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my own kindred, and of my father&rsquo;s house.


<a id="orgdd978ae"></a>

## Genesis 24:41

But thou shalt be clear from my curse, when thou shalt come to my kindred, if they will not give thee one.


<a id="orgf7d62ec"></a>

## Genesis 24:42

And I came today to the well of water, and said: O Lord God of my master, Abraham, if thou hast prospered my way, wherein I now walk,


<a id="org4664e4f"></a>

## Genesis 24:43

Behold, I stand by the well of water, and the virgin, that shall come out to draw water, who shall hear me say: Give me a little water to drink of thy pitcher:


<a id="org04260de"></a>

## Genesis 24:44

And shall say to me: Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels: let the same be the woman, whom the Lord hath prepared for my master&rsquo;s son.


<a id="org9bb2bb4"></a>

## Genesis 24:45

And whilst I pondered these things secretly with myself, Rebecca appeared, coming with a pitcher, which she carried on her shoulder: and she went down to the well and drew water. And I said to her: Give me a little to drink.


<a id="org9caa170"></a>

## Genesis 24:46

And she speedily let down the pitcher from her shoulder, and said to me: Both drink thou, and to thy camels I will give drink. I drank, and she watered the camels.


<a id="orgac94883"></a>

## Genesis 24:47

And I asked her, and said: Whose daughter art thou? And she answered: I am the daughter of Bathuel, the son of Nachor, whom Melcha bore to him. So I put earrings on her to adorn her face, and I put bracelets on her hands.


<a id="orgd5c18a3"></a>

## Genesis 24:48

And falling down, I adored the Lord, blessing the Lord God of my master, Abraham, who hath brought me the straight way to take the daughter of my master&rsquo;s brother for his son.


<a id="org66af7a0"></a>

## Genesis 24:49

Wherefore, if you do according to mercy and truth with my master, tell me: but if it please you otherwise, tell me that also, that I may go to the right hand, or to the left.


<a id="org3d648d4"></a>

## Genesis 24:50

And Laban and Bathuel answered: The word hath proceeded from the Lord: we cannot speak any other thing to thee but his pleasure.


<a id="orgf053d03"></a>

## Genesis 24:51

Behold, Rebecca is before thee, take her and go thy way, and let her be the wife of thy master&rsquo;s son, as the Lord hath spoken.


<a id="org1c1bcaa"></a>

## Genesis 24:52

Which when Abraham&rsquo;s servant heard, falling down to the ground, he adored the Lord.


<a id="org51e63ab"></a>

## Genesis 24:53

And bringing forth vessels of silver and gold, and garments, he gave them to Rebecca, for a present. He offered gifts also to her brothers, and to her mother.


<a id="orgee1de12"></a>

## Genesis 24:54

And a banquet was made, and they ate and drank together, and lodged there. And in the morning, the servant arose, and said: Let me depart, that I may go to my master.


<a id="orgb416b4f"></a>

## Genesis 24:55

And her brother and mother answered: Let the maid stay, at least, ten days with us, and afterwards she shall depart.


<a id="orgcf2deb9"></a>

## Genesis 24:56

Stay me not, said he, because the Lord hath prospered my way: send me away, that I may go to my master.


<a id="orgf35cde4"></a>

## Genesis 24:57

And they said: Let us call the maid, and ask her will.


<a id="orgf565039"></a>

## Genesis 24:58

And they called her, and when she was come, they asked: Wilt thou go with this man? She said: I will go.


<a id="org8bb621d"></a>

## Genesis 24:59

So they sent her away, and her nurse, and Abraham&rsquo;s servant, and his company.


<a id="orge5f5538"></a>

## Genesis 24:60

Wishing prosperity to their sister, and saying: Thou art our sister, mayst thou increase to thousands of thousands; and may thy seed possess the gates of their enemies.


<a id="org930a602"></a>

## Genesis 24:61

So Rebecca and her maids, being set upon camels, followed the man: who with speed returned to his master.


<a id="org885bddd"></a>

## Genesis 24:62

At the same time, Isaac was walking along the way to the well which is called Of the living and the seeing: for he dwelt in the south country:


<a id="orgfded690"></a>

## Genesis 24:63

And he was gone forth to meditate in the field, the day being now well spent: and when he had lifted up his eyes, he saw camels coming afar off.


<a id="orga1025ef"></a>

## Genesis 24:64

Rebecca also, when she saw Isaac, lighted off the camel,


<a id="org65745f3"></a>

## Genesis 24:65

And said to the servant: Who is that man who cometh towards us along the field? And he said to her: That man is my master. But she quickly took her cloak, and covered herself.


<a id="org47eb23a"></a>

## Genesis 24:66

And the servant told Isaac all that he had done.


<a id="orgfe9c488"></a>

## Genesis 24:67

Who brought her into the tent of Sara his mother, and took her to wife: and he loved her so much, that it moderated the sorrow which was occasioned by his mother&rsquo;s death.


<a id="org7a44374"></a>

# Genesis 25


<a id="org819ad2b"></a>

## Genesis 25:1

And Abraham married another wife named Cetura:


<a id="org3979342"></a>

## Genesis 25:2

Who bore him Zamram, and Jecsan, and Madan, and Madian, and Jesboc, and Sue.


<a id="orga638ed9"></a>

## Genesis 25:3

Jecsan also begot Saba, and Dadan. The children of Dadan were Assurim, and Latusim, and Loomim.


<a id="org725553a"></a>

## Genesis 25:4

But of Madian was born Epha, and Opher, and Henoch, and Abida, and Eldaa: all these were the children of Cetura.


<a id="org6cc8ee8"></a>

## Genesis 25:5

And Abraham gave all his possessions to Isaac:


<a id="org474f155"></a>

## Genesis 25:6

And to the children of the concubines he gave gifts, and separated them from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, to the east country.


<a id="org13bbf00"></a>

## Genesis 25:7

And the days of Abraham&rsquo;s life were a hundred and seventy-five years.


<a id="orgb0434c5"></a>

## Genesis 25:8

And decaying he died in a good old age, and having lived a long time, and being full of days: and was gathered to his people.


<a id="org14d1496"></a>

## Genesis 25:9

And Isaac and Ismael his sons buried him in the double cave, which was situated in the field of Ephron the son of Seor the Hethite, over against Mambre,


<a id="orgb3c1081"></a>

## Genesis 25:10

Which he had bought of the children of Heth: there was he buried, and Sara his wife.


<a id="org54361bb"></a>

## Genesis 25:11

And after his death, God blessed Isaac his son, who dwelt by the well named Of the living and seeing.


<a id="org6d4edd2"></a>

## Genesis 25:12

These are the generations of Ismael the son of Abraham, whom Agar the Egyptian, Sara&rsquo;s servant, bore unto him:


<a id="orgadff088"></a>

## Genesis 25:13

And these are the names of his children according to their calling and generations. The firstborn of Ismael was Nabajoth, then Cedar, and Adbeel, and Mabsam,


<a id="org7b75481"></a>

## Genesis 25:14

And Masma, and Duma, and Massa,


<a id="org4398208"></a>

## Genesis 25:15

Hadar, and Thema, and Jethur, and Naphis, and Cedma.


<a id="org0a32935"></a>

## Genesis 25:16

These are the sons of Ismael: and these are their names by their castles and towns, twelve princes of their tribes.


<a id="orgd2175f6"></a>

## Genesis 25:17

And the years of Ismael&rsquo;s life were a hundred and thirty-seven, and decaying he died, and was gathered unto his people.


<a id="org33f8538"></a>

## Genesis 25:18

And he dwelt from Hevila as far as Sur, which looketh towards Egypt, to them that go towards the Assyrians. He died in the presence of all his brethren.


<a id="org577b108"></a>

## Genesis 25:19

These also are the generations of Isaac the son of Abraham: Abraham begot Isaac:


<a id="org4bf75b9"></a>

## Genesis 25:20

Who when he was forty years old, took to wife Rebecca the daughter of Bathuel the Syrian of Mesopotamia, sister to Laban.


<a id="orgc1a7f0c"></a>

## Genesis 25:21

And Isaac besought the Lord for his wife, because she was barren: and he heard him, and made Rebecca to conceive.


<a id="orgb1361a4"></a>

## Genesis 25:22

But the children struggled in her womb, and she said: If it were to be so with me, what need was there to conceive? And she went to consult the Lord.


<a id="org22eed37"></a>

## Genesis 25:23

And he answering, said: Two nations are in thy womb, and two peoples shall be divided out of thy womb, and one people shall overcome the other, and the elder shall serve the younger.


<a id="org527a715"></a>

## Genesis 25:24

And when her time was come to be delivered, behold twins were found in her womb.


<a id="org3b6a22d"></a>

## Genesis 25:25

He that came forth first was red, and hairy like a skin: and his name was called Esau. Immediately the other coming forth, held his brother&rsquo;s foot in his hand: and therefore he was called Jacob.


<a id="orgae140e9"></a>

## Genesis 25:26

Isaac was threescore years old when the children were born unto him.


<a id="org1b5a5f5"></a>

## Genesis 25:27

And when they were grown up, Esau became a skilful hunter, and a husbandman: but Jacob, a plain man, dwelt in tents.


<a id="org666983e"></a>

## Genesis 25:28

Isaac loved Esau, because he ate of his hunting: and Rebecca loved Jacob.


<a id="orgbc60ba2"></a>

## Genesis 25:29

And Jacob boiled pottage: to whom Esau, coming faint out of the field,


<a id="org7e7c00d"></a>

## Genesis 25:30

Said: Give me of this red pottage, for I am exceeding faint. For which reason his name was called Edom.


<a id="org0a36438"></a>

## Genesis 25:31

And Jacob said to him: Sell me thy first birthright.


<a id="org6939a59"></a>

## Genesis 25:32

He answered: Lo I die, what will the first birthright avail me?


<a id="org236a7e6"></a>

## Genesis 25:33

Jacob said: Swear therefore to me. Esau swore to him, and sold his first birthright.


<a id="orgd40fea7"></a>

## Genesis 25:34

And so taking bread and the pottage of lentils, he ate, and drank, and went on his way; making little account of having sold his first birthright.


<a id="orgf2f1a48"></a>

# Genesis 26


<a id="org6458546"></a>

## Genesis 26:1

And when a famine came in the land, after that barrenness which had happened in the days of Abraham, Isaac went to Abimelech, king of the Palestines, to Gerara.


<a id="org2929b86"></a>

## Genesis 26:2

And the Lord appeared to him, and said: Go not down into Egypt, but stay in the land that I shall tell thee.


<a id="org85ef844"></a>

## Genesis 26:3

And sojourn in it, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee: for to thee and to thy seed I will give all these countries, to fulfil the oath which I swore to Abraham thy father.


<a id="orgb6412d5"></a>

## Genesis 26:4

And I will multiply thy seed like the stars of heaven: and I will give to thy posterity all these countries: and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.


<a id="org7a95f60"></a>

## Genesis 26:5

Because Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my precepts and commandments, and observed my ceremonies and laws.


<a id="org933aae0"></a>

## Genesis 26:6

So Isaac abode in Gerara.


<a id="org94f94f2"></a>

## Genesis 26:7

And when he was asked by the men of that place, concerning his wife, he answered: She is my sister: for he was afraid to confess that she was his wife, thinking lest perhaps they would kill him because of her beauty.


<a id="org46797ee"></a>

## Genesis 26:8

And when very many days were passed, and he abode there, Abimelech, king of the Palestines, looking out through a window, saw him playing with Rebecca, his wife.


<a id="orgc96c642"></a>

## Genesis 26:9

And calling for him, he said: It is evident she is thy wife: why didst thou feign her to be thy sister? He answered: I feared lest I should die for her sake.


<a id="orga63b94b"></a>

## Genesis 26:10

And Abimelech said: Why hast thou deceived us? Some man of the people might have lain with thy wife, and thou hadst brought upon us a great sin. And he commanded all the people, saying:


<a id="org4b80e62"></a>

## Genesis 26:11

He that shall touch this man&rsquo;s wife, shall surely be put to death.


<a id="org9333dc1"></a>

## Genesis 26:12

And Isaac sowed in that land, and he found that same year a hundredfold: and the Lord blessed him.


<a id="orgcc34520"></a>

## Genesis 26:13

And the man was enriched, and he went on prospering and increasing, till he became exceeding great.


<a id="org5d4f4e9"></a>

## Genesis 26:14

And he had possessions of sheep and of herds, and a very great family. Wherefore the Palestines envying him,


<a id="org6353b8c"></a>

## Genesis 26:15

Stopped up at that time all the wells, that the servants of his father, Abraham, had digged, filling them up with earth:


<a id="org6f2cde0"></a>

## Genesis 26:16

Insomuch that Abimelech himself said to Isaac: Depart from us, for thou art become much mightier than we.


<a id="orgb02fe93"></a>

## Genesis 26:17

So he departed, and came to the torrent of Gerara, to dwell there:


<a id="org1fcd6bc"></a>

## Genesis 26:18

And he digged again other wells, which the servants of his father, Abraham, had digged, and which, after his death, the Philistines had of old stopped up: and he called them by the same names, by which his father before had called them.


<a id="orgf97f701"></a>

## Genesis 26:19

And they digged in the torrent, and found living water:


<a id="org246a56f"></a>

## Genesis 26:20

But there also the herdsmen of Gerara strove against the herdsmen of Isaac, saying: It is our water. Wherefore he called the name of the well, on occasion of that which had happened, Calumny.


<a id="org57efce5"></a>

## Genesis 26:21

And they digged also another; and for that they quarrelled likewise, and he called the name of it, Enmity.


<a id="org6014898"></a>

## Genesis 26:22

Going forward from thence, he digged another well, for which they contended not; therefore he called the name thereof, Latitude, saying: Now hath the Lord given us room, and made us to increase upon the earth.


<a id="org191be71"></a>

## Genesis 26:23

And he went up from that place to Bersabee,


<a id="orged12d3d"></a>

## Genesis 26:24

Where the Lord appeared to him that same night, saying: I am the God of Abraham thy father, do not fear, for I am with thee: I will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham&rsquo;s sake.


<a id="org4906f32"></a>

## Genesis 26:25

And he built there an altar: and called upon the name of the Lord, and pitched his tent; and commanded his servants to dig a well.


<a id="orga5bcefb"></a>

## Genesis 26:26

To which place when Abimelech, and Ochozath his friend, and Phicol chief captain of his soldiers, came from Gerara,


<a id="orge9d3ec0"></a>

## Genesis 26:27

Isaac said to them: Why are ye come to me, a man whom you hate, and have thrust out from you?


<a id="org1fee605"></a>

## Genesis 26:28

And they answered: We saw that the Lord is with thee, and therefore we said: Let there be an oath between us, and let us make a covenant,


<a id="orgbea50e4"></a>

## Genesis 26:29

That thou do us no harm, as we on our part have touched nothing of thine, nor have done any thing to hurt thee; but with peace have sent thee away, increased with the blessing of the Lord.


<a id="org9d88aad"></a>

## Genesis 26:30

And he made them a feast, and after they had eaten and drunk:


<a id="org94ed507"></a>

## Genesis 26:31

Arising in the morning, they swore one to another: and Isaac sent them away peaceably to their own home.


<a id="orgc0f58e1"></a>

## Genesis 26:32

And behold, the same day the servants of Isaac came, telling him of a well which they had digged, and saying: We have found water.


<a id="org6af8b5a"></a>

## Genesis 26:33

Whereupon he called it Abundance: and the name of the city was called Bersabee, even to this day.


<a id="orgf0c2ae7"></a>

## Genesis 26:34

And Esau being forty years old, married wives, Judith, the daughter of Beeri, the Hethite, and Basemath, the daughter of Elon, of the same place.


<a id="orgbac67bd"></a>

## Genesis 26:35

And they both offended the mind of Isaac and Rebecca.


<a id="org9cec6af"></a>

# Genesis 27


<a id="org4420a8e"></a>

## Genesis 27:1

Now Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, and he could not see: and he called Esau, his elder son, and said to him: My son? And he answered: Here I am.


<a id="orgfdb1f59"></a>

## Genesis 27:2

And his father said to him, Thou seest that I am old, and know not the day of my death.


<a id="org6c308cb"></a>

## Genesis 27:3

Take thy arms, thy quiver, and bow, and go abroad; and when thou hast taken something by hunting,


<a id="orgef5607f"></a>

## Genesis 27:4

Make me a savoury meat thereof, as thou knowest I like, and bring it that I may eat: and my soul may bless thee, before I die.


<a id="orgb6afdb3"></a>

## Genesis 27:5

And when Rebecca had heard this, and he was gone into the field to fulfil his father&rsquo;s commandment,


<a id="orge4cc0cd"></a>

## Genesis 27:6

She said to her son Jacob: I heard thy father talking with Esau, thy brother, and saying to him:


<a id="org677aa5c"></a>

## Genesis 27:7

Bring me of thy hunting, and make me meats that I may eat, and bless thee in the sight of the Lord, before I die.


<a id="orgdc4bad7"></a>

## Genesis 27:8

Now therefore, my son, follow my counsel:


<a id="org06418f1"></a>

## Genesis 27:9

And go thy way to the flock, bring me two kids of the best, that I may make of them meat for thy father, such as he gladly eateth.


<a id="org8700400"></a>

## Genesis 27:10

Which when thou hast brought in, and he hath eaten, he may bless thee before he die.


<a id="org3462baa"></a>

## Genesis 27:11

And he answered her: Thou knowest that Esau, my brother, is a hairy man, and I am smooth:


<a id="org4d36414"></a>

## Genesis 27:12

If my father should feel me, and perceive it, I fear lest he will think I would have mocked him, and I shall bring upon me a curse instead of a blessing.


<a id="org163cae5"></a>

## Genesis 27:13

And his mother said to him: Upon me be this curse, my son: only hear thou my voice, and go, fetch me the things which I have said.


<a id="org429ba74"></a>

## Genesis 27:14

He went, and brought, and gave them to his mother. She dressed meats, such as she knew his father liked.


<a id="org95d4b53"></a>

## Genesis 27:15

And she put on him very good garments of Esau, which she had at home with her:


<a id="org587d893"></a>

## Genesis 27:16

And the little skins of the kids she put about his hands, and covered the bare of his neck.

## Genesis 27:20

And Isaac said to his son: How couldst thou find it so quickly, my son? He answered: It was the will of God, that what I sought came quickly in my way:


<a id="org1ac764b"></a>

## Genesis 27:21

And Isaac said: Come hither, that I may feel thee, my son, and may prove whether thou be my son Esau, or no.


<a id="orge39ab04"></a>

## Genesis 27:22

He came near to his father, and when he had felt him, Isaac said: The voice indeed is the voice of Jacob; but the hands, are the hands of Esau.


<a id="org8b83ff5"></a>

## Genesis 27:23

And he knew him not, because his hairy hands made him like to the elder. Then blessing him,


<a id="orgc74d6ba"></a>

## Genesis 27:24

He said: Art thou my son Esau? He answered: I am.


<a id="orgf08a745"></a>

## Genesis 27:25

Then he said: Bring me the meats of thy hunting, my son, that my soul may bless thee. And when they were brought, and he had eaten, he offered him wine also, which after he had drunk,


<a id="org766b10a"></a>

## Genesis 27:26

He said to him: Come near me, and give me a kiss, my son.


<a id="org1762e5b"></a>

## Genesis 27:27

He came near, and kissed him. And immediately as he smelled the fragrant smell of his garments, blessing him, he said: Behold, the smell of my son is as the smell of a plentiful field, which the Lord hath blessed.

## Genesis 27:30

Isaac had scarce ended his words, when, Jacob being now gone out abroad, Esau came,


<a id="org00bdf40"></a>

## Genesis 27:31

Isaac was struck with fear, and astonished exceedingly; and wondering beyond what can be believed, said: Who is he then that even now brought me venison that he had taken, and I ate of all before thou camest? and I have blessed him, and he shall be blessed.


<a id="org32c1347"></a>

## Genesis 27:34

## Genesis 27:35

And he said: Thy brother came deceitfully and got thy blessing.


<a id="org20efb09"></a>

## Genesis 27:36

But he said again: Rightly is his name called Jacob; for he hath supplanted me lo this second time: My birthright he took away before, and now this second time he hath stolen away my blessing. And again he said to his father: Hast thou not reserved me also a blessing?


<a id="orgfbd324f"></a>

## Genesis 27:37

Isaac answered: I have appointed him thy lord, and have made all his brethren his servants: I have established him with corn and wine, and after this, what shall I do more for thee, my son?


<a id="org3dd725c"></a>

## Genesis 27:38

And Esau said to him: Hast thou only one blessing, father? I beseech thee bless me also. And when he wept with a loud cry,


<a id="orgfa36a72"></a>

Isaac being moved, said to him: In the fat of the earth, and in the dew of heaven from above,


<a id="orgc3f108a"></a>

## Genesis 27:40

Shall thy blessing be. Thou shalt live by the sword, and shalt serve thy brother: and the time shall come, when thou shalt shake off and loose his yoke from thy neck.

## Genesis 27:41

## Genesis 27:43

Now therefore, my son, hear my voice, arise and flee to Laban, my brother, to Haran:

## Genesis 27:44

And thou shalt dwell with him a few days, till the wrath of thy brother be assuaged,


<a id="orgfa7b806"></a>

## Genesis 27:45

And his indignation cease, and he forget the things thou hast done to him: afterwards I will send, and bring thee from thence hither. Why shall I be deprived of both my sons in one day?


<a id="org048162b"></a>

## Genesis 27:46

And Rebecca said to Isaac: I am weary of my life, because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the stock of this land, I choose not to live.

<a id="orgeec33a2"></a>

And Esau seeing that his father had blessed Jacob, and had sent him into Mesopotamia of Syria, to marry a wife thence; and that after the blessing he had charged him, saying: Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Chanaan:

## Genesis 28:7

And that Jacob obeying his parents, was gone into Syria:


<a id="orgd007ff9"></a>

Experiencing also, that his father was not well pleased with the daughters of Chanaan:


<a id="org30555c0"></a>

## Genesis 28:9

And he saw in his sleep a ladder standing upon the earth, and the top thereof touching heaven: the angels also of God ascending and descending by it.


<a id="org91d1a7a"></a>

## Genesis 28:13

And the Lord leaning upon the ladder saying to him: I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: The land, wherein thou sleepest, I will give to thee and to thy seed.


<a id="org31289d3"></a>

## Genesis 28:14

And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth: thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and IN THEE and thy seed, all the tribes of the earth SHALL BE BLESSED.


<a id="org6a1e241"></a>

## Genesis 28:15

And when Jacob awaked out of sleep, he said: Indeed the Lord is in this place, and I knew it not.


<a id="org2f8dbba"></a>

And trembling, he said: How terrible is this place? this is no other but the house of God, and the gate of heaven.


<a id="orgbbdf045"></a>

# Genesis 29


<a id="orga63f667"></a>

## Genesis 29:1

Then Jacob went on in his journey, and came into the east country.


<a id="org8127faa"></a>

## Genesis 29:2

And he saw a well in the field, and three flocks of sheep lying by it: for the beasts were watered out of it, and the mouth thereof was closed with a great stone.


<a id="org6715b05"></a>

## Genesis 29:3

And the custom was, when all the sheep were gathered together, to roll away the stone, and after the sheep were watered, to put it on the mouth of the well again.


<a id="orgff1fc33"></a>

## Genesis 29:4

And he said to the shepherds: Brethren, whence are you? They answered: Of Haran.


<a id="org086227a"></a>

## Genesis 29:5

And he asked them, saying: Know you Laban, the son of Nachor? They said: We know him.


<a id="org52d3c38"></a>

## Genesis 29:6

He said: Is he in health? He is in health, say they: and behold, Rachel, his daughter, cometh with his flock.


<a id="orgc514a96"></a>

## Genesis 29:7

And Jacob said: There is yet much day remaining, neither is it time to bring the flocks into the folds again: first give the sheep drink, and so lead them back to feed.


<a id="orgc5ddfc3"></a>

## Genesis 29:8

They answered: We cannot, till all the cattle be gathered together, and we remove the stone from the well&rsquo;s mouth, that we may water the flocks.


<a id="orgbd65828"></a>

## Genesis 29:9

They were yet speaking, and behold Rachel came with her father&rsquo;s sheep; for she fed the flock.


<a id="org17e28a1"></a>

## Genesis 29:10

And when Jacob saw her, and knew her to be his cousin german, and that they were the sheep of Laban, his uncle: he removed the stone wherewith the well was closed.


<a id="orga82d260"></a>

## Genesis 29:11

And having watered the flock, he kissed her: and lifting up his voice wept.


<a id="orgd16aad8"></a>

## Genesis 29:12

And he told her that he was her father&rsquo;s brother, and the son of Rebecca: but she went in haste and told her father.


<a id="orgcb5d8a9"></a>

## Genesis 29:13

Who, when he heard that Jacob his sister&rsquo;s son was come, ran forth to meet him: and embracing him, and heartily kissing him, brought him into his house. And when he had heard the causes of his journey,


<a id="org55c805f"></a>

## Genesis 29:14

He answered: Thou art my bone and my flesh. And after the days of one month were expired,


<a id="org49736f1"></a>

## Genesis 29:15

He said to him: Because thou art my brother, shalt thou serve me without wages? Tell me what wages thou wilt have.


<a id="org87f6323"></a>

## Genesis 29:16

Now he had two daughters, the name of the elder was Lia; and the younger was called Rachel.


<a id="org58fc23a"></a>

## Genesis 29:17

But Lia was blear-eyed: Rachel was well favoured, and of a beautiful countenance.


<a id="orgfbec536"></a>

## Genesis 29:18

And Jacob being in love with her, said: I will serve thee seven years for Rachel, thy younger daughter.


<a id="orgca2a908"></a>

## Genesis 29:19

Laban answered: It is better that I give her to thee than to another man; stay with me.


<a id="orgca8d581"></a>

## Genesis 29:20

So Jacob served seven years for Rachel: and they seemed but a few days, because of the greatness of his love.


<a id="org6b052b5"></a>

## Genesis 29:21

And he said to Laban: Give me my wife; for now the time is fulfilled, that I may go in unto her.


<a id="orgffc7ecd"></a>

## Genesis 29:22

And he, having invited a great number of his friends to the feast, made the marriage.


<a id="orgcfe3a50"></a>

## Genesis 29:23

And at night he brought in Lia, his daughter, to him,


<a id="org926516a"></a>

## Genesis 29:24

Giving his daughter a handmaid, named Zelpha. Now when Jacob had gone in to her according to custom, when morning was come he saw it was Lia.


<a id="orgfbcdd21"></a>

## Genesis 29:25

And he said to his father-in-law: What is it that thou didst mean to do? did not I serve thee for Rachel? why hast thou deceived me?


<a id="org30edae1"></a>

## Genesis 29:26

Laban answered: It is not the custom in this place, to give the younger in marriage first.


<a id="org01fd3ea"></a>

## Genesis 29:27

Make up the week of days of this match: and I will give thee her also, for the service that thou shalt render me other seven years.


<a id="orgb3daf34"></a>

## Genesis 29:28

He yielded to his pleasure: and after the week was past, he married Rachel:


<a id="orga6d439b"></a>

## Genesis 29:29

To whom her father gave Bala, for her servant.


<a id="org9d3e6d7"></a>

## Genesis 29:30

And having at length obtained the marriage he wished for, he preferred the love of the latter before the former, and served with him other seven years.


<a id="orge1efc4f"></a>

## Genesis 29:31

And the Lord seeing that he despised Lia, opened her womb, but her sister remained barren.


<a id="orgfba8729"></a>

## Genesis 29:32

And she conceived and bore a son, and called his name Ruben, saying: The Lord saw my affliction: now my husband will love me.


<a id="org105503c"></a>

## Genesis 29:33

And again she conceived and bore a son, and said: Because the Lord heard that I was despised, he hath given this also to me: and she called his name Simeon.


<a id="org92dc5ff"></a>

## Genesis 29:34

And she conceived the third time, and bore another son, and said: Now also my husband will be joined to me, because I have borne him three sons: and therefore she called his name Levi.


<a id="orgf205f83"></a>

## Genesis 29:35

The fourth time she conceived and bore a son, and said: Now will I praise the Lord: and for this she called him Juda. And she left bearing.


<a id="org261c9ac"></a>

# Genesis 30


<a id="org551505c"></a>

## Genesis 30:1

And Rachel seeing herself without children, envied her sister, and said to her husband: Give me children, otherwise I shall die.


<a id="org01045f6"></a>

## Genesis 30:2

And Jacob being angry with her, answered: Am I as God, who hath deprived thee of the fruit of thy womb?


<a id="org3e3b7dd"></a>

## Genesis 30:3

But she said: I have here my servant Bala: go in unto her, that she may bear upon my knees, and I may have children by her.


<a id="org77dbc47"></a>

## Genesis 30:4

And she gave him Bala in marriage: who,


<a id="org15f79e7"></a>

## Genesis 30:5

When her husband had gone in unto her, conceived and bore a son.


<a id="org166930e"></a>

## Genesis 30:6

And Rachel said: The Lord hath judged for me, and hath heard my voice, giving me a son; and therefore she called his name Dan.


<a id="org008b85e"></a>

## Genesis 30:7

And again Bala conceived, and bore another,


<a id="orgcd55547"></a>

## Genesis 30:8

For whom Rachel said: God hath compared me with my sister, and I have prevailed: and she called him Nephthali.


<a id="org87d49d7"></a>

## Genesis 30:9

Lia perceiving that she had left of bearing, gave Zelpha, her handmaid, to her husband.


<a id="org94257e0"></a>

## Genesis 30:10

And when she had conceived, and brought forth a son,


<a id="org4ee0f85"></a>

## Genesis 30:11

She said: Happily. And therefore called his name Gad.


<a id="org2acb1f3"></a>

## Genesis 30:12

Zelpha also bore another.


<a id="org488344f"></a>

## Genesis 30:13

And Lia said: This is for my happiness: for women will call me blessed. Therefore she called him Aser.


<a id="org65e3057"></a>

## Genesis 30:14

And Ruben going out in the time of the wheat harvest into the field, found mandrakes: which he brought to his mother Lia. And Rachel said: Give me part of thy son&rsquo;s mandrakes.


<a id="org43f832f"></a>

## Genesis 30:15

She answered: Dost thou think it a small matter, that thou hast taken my husband from me, unless thou take also my son&rsquo;s mandrakes? Rachel said: He shall sleep with thee this night, for thy son&rsquo;s mandrakes.


<a id="orgfb995cc"></a>

## Genesis 30:16

And when Jacob returned at even from the field, Lia went out to meet him, and said: Thou shalt come in unto me, because I have hired thee for my son&rsquo;s mandrakes. And he slept with her that night.


<a id="org4dd467b"></a>

## Genesis 30:17

And God heard her prayers; and she conceived: and bore a fifth son:


<a id="orga6e39a4"></a>

## Genesis 30:18

And said: God hath given me a reward, because I gave my handmaid to my husband. And she called his name Issachar.


<a id="orgbaa5bd2"></a>

## Genesis 30:19

And Lia conceived again, and bore the sixth son,


<a id="orgd0dca67"></a>

## Genesis 30:20

And said: God hath endowed me with a good dowry; this turn also my husband will be with me, because I have borne him six sons: and therefore she called his name Zabulon.


<a id="orgc811641"></a>

## Genesis 30:21

After whom she bore a daughter, named Dina.


<a id="orgb736c37"></a>

## Genesis 30:22

The Lord also remembering Rachel, heard her, and opened her womb.


<a id="org29d1122"></a>

## Genesis 30:23

And she conceived, and bore a son, saying: God hath taken away my reproach.


<a id="orgf7f6a65"></a>

## Genesis 30:24

And she called his name Joseph: saying: The Lord give me also another son.


<a id="orgbfa350e"></a>

## Genesis 30:25

And when Joseph was born, Jacob said to his father-in-law: Send me away, that I may return into my country, and to my land.


<a id="org53965fa"></a>

## Genesis 30:26

Give me my wives, and my children, for whom I have served thee, that I may depart: thou knowest the service that I have rendered thee.


<a id="orgd23c44c"></a>

## Genesis 30:27

Laban said to him: Let me find favour in thy sight: I have learned, by experience, that God hath blessed me for thy sake.


<a id="org50df023"></a>

## Genesis 30:28

Appoint thy wages which I shall give thee.


<a id="org935c3e2"></a>

## Genesis 30:29

But he answered: Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how great thy possession hath been in my hands.


<a id="orgb13c2cc"></a>

## Genesis 30:30

Thou hadst but little before I came to thee, and now thou art become rich: and the Lord hath blessed thee at my coming. It is reasonable, therefore, that I should now provide also for my own house.


<a id="org3c2b04a"></a>

## Genesis 30:31

And Laban said: What shall I give thee? But he said: I require nothing; but if thou wilt do what I demand, I will feed and keep thy sheep again.


<a id="orgdd2b3c9"></a>

## Genesis 30:32

Go round through all thy flocks, and separate all the sheep of divers colours, and speckled; and all that is brown and spotted, and of divers colours, as well among the sheep as among the goats, shall be my wages.


<a id="org4f7ac8a"></a>

## Genesis 30:33

And my justice shall answer for me tomorrow before thee, when the time of the bargain shall come; and all that is not of divers colours, and spotted, and brown, as well among the sheep as among the goats, shall accuse me of theft.


<a id="orgd3b8b4e"></a>

## Genesis 30:34

And Laban said: I like well what thou demandest.


<a id="orge7863c1"></a>

## Genesis 30:35

And he separated the same day the she-goats, and the sheep, and the he-goats, and the rams of divers colours, and spotted; and all the flock of one colour, that is, of white and black fleece, he delivered into the hands of his sons.


<a id="org0c24a33"></a>

## Genesis 30:36

And he set the space of three days journey betwixt himself and his son-in-law, who fed the rest of his flock.


<a id="org2d08989"></a>

## Genesis 30:37

And Jacob took green rods of poplar, and of almond, and of plane-trees, and pilled them in part: so when the bark was taken off, in the parts that were pilled, there appeared whiteness: but the parts that were whole, remained green: and by this means the colour was divers.


<a id="org5358408"></a>

## Genesis 30:38

And he put them in the troughs, where the water was poured out; that when the flocks should come to drink, they might have the rods before their eyes, and in the sight of them might conceive.


<a id="orga2f311b"></a>

## Genesis 30:39

And it came to pass, that in the very heat of coition, the sheep beheld the rods, and brought forth spotted, and of divers colours, and speckled.


<a id="org467b099"></a>

## Genesis 30:40

And Jacob separated the flock, and put the rods in the troughs before the eyes of the rams; and all the white and the black were Laban&rsquo;s, and the rest were Jacob&rsquo;s, when the flocks were separated one from the other.


<a id="orgb76e65e"></a>

## Genesis 30:41

So when the ewes went first to ram, Jacob put the rods in the troughs of water before the eyes of the rams, and of the ewes, that they might conceive while they were looking upon them.


<a id="orgdd4cc82"></a>

## Genesis 30:42

But when the later coming was, and the last conceiving, he did not put them. And those that were lateward, became Laban&rsquo;s; and they of the first time, Jacob&rsquo;s.


<a id="org175cace"></a>

## Genesis 30:43

And the man was enriched exceedingly, and he had many flocks, maid-servants and men-servants, camels and asses.

<a id="orgda5fcbd"></a>

## Genesis 31:1

But after that he had heard the words of the sons of Laban, saying: Jacob hath taken away all that was our father&rsquo;s, and being enriched by his substance is become great.


<a id="org79d4e31"></a>

## Genesis 31:2

And perceiving also, that Laban&rsquo;s countenance was not towards him as yesterday and the other day.


<a id="org4ebc579"></a>

## Genesis 31:3

Especially the Lord saying to him: Return into the land of thy fathers and to thy kindred, and I will be with thee.


<a id="orga920619"></a>

## Genesis 31:4

He sent, and called Rachel and Lia into the field, where he fed the flocks,


<a id="org58c7d07"></a>

## Genesis 31:5

And said to them: I see your father&rsquo;s countenance is not towards me as yesterday and the other day: but the God of my father hath been with me.

## Genesis 31:6

And you know that I have served your father to the uttermost of my power.


<a id="orgb887bbc"></a>

## Genesis 31:7

Yea your father hath also overreached me, and hath changed my wages ten times: and yet God hath not suffered him to hurt me.


<a id="org5e68e4d"></a>

## Genesis 31:8

If at any time, he said: The speckled shall be thy wages: all the sheep brought forth speckled: but when he said on the contrary: Thou shalt take all the white one for thy wages: all the flocks brought forth white ones.


<a id="org9edacf8"></a>

## Genesis 31:9

And God hath taken your father&rsquo;s substance, and given it to me.


<a id="org0e478c7"></a>

## Genesis 31:10

For after the time came of the ewes conceiving, I lifted up my eyes, and saw in my sleep, that the males which leaped upon the females were of divers colours, and spotted, and speckled.


<a id="org0f8d05b"></a>

## Genesis 31:11

And the angel of God said to me in my sleep: Jacob. And I answered: Here I am.


<a id="orgface599"></a>

## Genesis 31:12

And he said: Lift up thy eyes, and see that all the males leaping upon the females, are of divers colours, spotted and speckled. For I have seen all that Laban hath done to thee.


<a id="orgd718e8e"></a>

## Genesis 31:13

I am the God of Bethel, where thou didst anoint the stone, and make a vow to me. Now therefore arise, and go out of this land, and return into thy native country.


<a id="orgabcf0d1"></a>

## Genesis 31:14

And Rachel and Lia answered: Have we any thing left among the goods and inheritance of our father&rsquo;s house?


<a id="org840a4aa"></a>

## Genesis 31:15

Hath he not counted us as strangers, and sold us, and eaten up the price of us?


<a id="orgdc0bf73"></a>

## Genesis 31:16

But God hath taken our father&rsquo;s riches, and delivered them to us, and to our children: wherefore, do all that God hath commanded thee.


<a id="org8c622fd"></a>

## Genesis 31:17

Then Jacob rose up, and having set his children and wives upon camels, went his way.


<a id="org0c9f777"></a>

## Genesis 31:18

And he took all his substance, and flocks, and whatsoever he had gotten in Mesopotamia, and went forward to Isaac, his father, to the land of Chanaan.


<a id="orgf8862f9"></a>

## Genesis 31:19

At that time Laban was gone to shear his sheep, and Rachel stole away her father&rsquo;s idols.


<a id="orgc4704b9"></a>

## Genesis 31:20

And Jacob would not confess to his father-in-law that he was flying away.


<a id="org5a23e58"></a>

## Genesis 31:21

And when he was gone, together with all that belonged to him, and having passed the river, was going on towards mount Galaad,


<a id="org889e8f3"></a>

## Genesis 31:22

It was told Laban on the third day, that Jacob fled.


<a id="org8320f66"></a>

## Genesis 31:23

And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days; and overtook him in the mount of Galaad.


<a id="orgc62425b"></a>

## Genesis 31:24

And he saw in a dream God, saying to him: Take heed thou speak not any thing harshly against Jacob.


<a id="org126236d"></a>

## Genesis 31:25

Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountain: and when he, with his brethren, had overtaken him, he pitched his tent in the same mount of Galaad.


<a id="orgebe0308"></a>

## Genesis 31:26

And he said to Jacob: Why hast thou done thus, to carry away, without my knowledge, my daughters as captives taken with the sword?


<a id="org3dc8ecf"></a>

## Genesis 31:27

Why wouldst thou run away privately, and not acquaint me, that I might have brought thee on the way with joy, and with songs, and with timbrels, and with harps?


<a id="orgb0060c0"></a>

## Genesis 31:28

Thou hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and daughters; thou hast done foolishly; and now indeed,


<a id="orgd730b9d"></a>

## Genesis 31:29

It is in my power to return thee evil; but the God of your father said to me yesterday: Take heed thou speak not any thing harshly against Jacob.


<a id="orge77a6e0"></a>

## Genesis 31:30

Suppose thou didst desire to go to thy friends, and hadst a longing after thy father&rsquo;s house: why hast thou stolen away my gods?


<a id="orgc498a46"></a>

## Genesis 31:31

Jacob answered: That I departed unknown to thee, it was for fear lest thou wouldst take away thy daughters by force.


<a id="org0507637"></a>

## Genesis 31:32

But, whereas, thou chargest me with theft: with whomsoever thou shalt find thy gods, let him be slain before our brethren. Search, and if thou find any of thy things with me, take them away. Now when he said this, he knew not that Rachel had stolen the idols.


<a id="org333e692"></a>

## Genesis 31:33

So Laban went into the tent of Jacob, and of Lia, and of both the handmaids, and found them not. And when he was entered into Rachel&rsquo;s tent,


<a id="org3a48192"></a>

## Genesis 31:34

She, in haste, hid the idols under the camel&rsquo;s furniture, and sat upon them: and when he had searched all the tent, and found nothing,


<a id="org8134a7f"></a>

## Genesis 31:35

She said: Let not my lord be angry that I cannot rise up before thee, because it has now happened to me according to the custom of women. So his careful search was in vain.


<a id="orga9ecc0f"></a>

## Genesis 31:36

And Jacob being angry, said in a chiding manner: For what fault of mine, and for what offence on my part hast thou so hotly pursued me,


<a id="orgfc32fdd"></a>

## Genesis 31:37

And searched all my household stuff? What hast thou found of all the substance of thy house? lay it here before my brethren, and thy brethren, and let them judge between me and thee.


<a id="org3466fcf"></a>

## Genesis 31:38

Have I, therefore, been with thee twenty years? thy ewes and goats were not barren, the rams of thy flocks I did not eat:


<a id="org65b2b8c"></a>

## Genesis 31:39

Neither did I shew thee that which the beast had torn; I made good all the damage: whatsoever was lost by theft, thou didst exact it of me:


<a id="org24f83e0"></a>

## Genesis 31:40

Day and night was I parched with heat, and with frost, and sleep departed from my eyes.


<a id="orgd7dbb11"></a>

## Genesis 31:41

And in this manner have I served thee in thy house twenty years, fourteen for thy daughters, and six for thy flocks: thou hast changed also my wages ten times.


<a id="org4f46a0d"></a>

## Genesis 31:42

Unless the God of my father, Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had stood by me, peradventure now thou hadst sent me away naked: God beheld my affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked thee yesterday.


<a id="orga1ca7fa"></a>

## Genesis 31:43

Laban answered him: The daughters are mine, and the children, and thy flocks, and all things that thou seest are mine: what can I do to my children, and grandchildren?


<a id="org7804b32"></a>

## Genesis 31:44

Come, therefore, let us enter into a league; that it may be for a testimony between me and thee.


<a id="orgc487acd"></a>

## Genesis 31:45

And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a title.


<a id="orgde67bcd"></a>

## Genesis 31:46

And he said to his brethren: Bring hither stones. And they, gathering stones together, made a heap, and they ate upon it.


<a id="org0297e00"></a>

## Genesis 31:47

And Laban called it, The witness heap; and Jacob, The hillock of testimony: each of them according to the propriety of his language.


<a id="org77b611d"></a>

## Genesis 31:48

And Laban said: This heap shall be a witness between me and thee this day, and therefore the name thereof was called Galaad, that is, The witness heap.


<a id="orgd8a6f86"></a>

## Genesis 31:49

The Lord behold and judge between us, when we shall be gone one from the other.


<a id="orgc91a2de"></a>

## Genesis 31:50

If thou afflict my daughters, and if thou bring in other wives over them: none is witness of our speech but God, who is present and beholdeth.


<a id="orge2525f0"></a>

## Genesis 31:51

And he said again to Jacob: Behold this heap, and the stone which I have set up between me and thee,


<a id="org8fe6789"></a>

## Genesis 31:52

Shall be a witness: this heap, I say, and the stone, be they for a testimony, if either I shall pass beyond it going towards thee, or thou shalt pass beyond it thinking harm to me.


<a id="org145e3b4"></a>

## Genesis 31:53

The God of Abraham, and the God of Nachor, the God of their father, judge between us. And Jacob swore by the fear of his father Isaac:


<a id="org9ef751c"></a>

## Genesis 31:54

And after he had offered sacrifices in the mountain, he called his brethren to eat bread. And when they had eaten, they lodged there:


<a id="orga9dd9cb"></a>

## Genesis 31:55

But Laban arose in the night, and kissed his sons and daughters, and blessed them: and returned to his place.


<a id="orgdb480e1"></a>

# Genesis 32


<a id="org32c66c3"></a>

## Genesis 32:1

Jacob also went on the journey he had begun: and the angels of God met him.


<a id="org3875df9"></a>

## Genesis 32:2

And when he saw them, he said: These are the camps of God, and he called the name of that place Mahanaim, that is, Camps.


<a id="org93fa513"></a>

## Genesis 32:3

And he sent messengers before him to Esau, his brother, to the land of Seir, to the country of Edom:


<a id="org80eec4f"></a>

## Genesis 32:4

And he commanded them, saying: Thus shall ye speak to my lord Esau: Thus saith thy brother Jacob: I have sojourned with Laban, and have been with him until this day:


<a id="org3b30d64"></a>

## Genesis 32:5

I have oxen, and asses, and sheep, and menservants, and womenservants: and now I send a message to my lord, that I may find favour in thy sight.


<a id="org45ad1e9"></a>

## Genesis 32:6

And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying: We came to Esau, thy brother, and behold he cometh with speed to meet thee with four hundred men.


<a id="org17a4de3"></a>

## Genesis 32:7

Then Jacob was greatly afraid; and in his fear divided the people that was with him, and the flocks, and the sheep, and the oxen, and the camels, into two companies,


<a id="org190967b"></a>

## Genesis 32:8

Saying: If Esau come to one company, and destroy it, the other company that is left, shall escape.


<a id="org7a6f13d"></a>

## Genesis 32:9

And Jacob said: O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac: O Lord who saidst to me, Return to thy land, and to the place of thy birth, and I will do well for thee.


<a id="org41bddbd"></a>

## Genesis 32:10

I am not worthy of the least of all thy mercies, and of thy truth which thou hast fulfilled to thy servant. With my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I return with two companies.


<a id="org420818f"></a>

## Genesis 32:11

Deliver me from the hand of my brother Esau, for I am greatly afraid of him; lest perhaps he come, and kill the mother with the children.


<a id="orgb6fcdb3"></a>

## Genesis 32:12

Thou didst say, that thou wouldst do well by me, and multiply my seed like the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.


<a id="org97178cc"></a>

## Genesis 32:13

And when he had slept there that night, he set apart, of the things which he had, presents for his brother Esau,


<a id="org9e73eab"></a>

## Genesis 32:14

Two hundred she-goats, twenty he-goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams,


<a id="orgb1c7508"></a>

## Genesis 32:15

Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and twenty bulls, twenty she-asses, and ten of their foals.


<a id="orgdb4c35d"></a>

## Genesis 32:16

And he sent them by the hands of his servants, every drove by itself, and he said to his servants: Go before me, and let there be a space between drove and drove.


<a id="org03be7db"></a>

## Genesis 32:17

And he commanded the first, saying: If thou meet my brother Esau, and he ask thee: Whose art thou? or whither goest thou? or whose are these before thee?


<a id="orgf2b1944"></a>

## Genesis 32:18

Thou shalt answer: Thy servant Jacob&rsquo;s: he hath sent them as a present to my lord Esau; and he cometh after us.


<a id="org8e1f318"></a>

## Genesis 32:19

In like manner he commanded the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying: Speak ye the same words to Esau, when ye find him.


<a id="org24bf64d"></a>

## Genesis 32:20

And ye shall add: Thy servant Jacob himself also followeth after us; for he said: I will appease him with the presents that go before, and afterwards I will see him, perhaps he will be gracious to me.


<a id="org1fdba12"></a>

## Genesis 32:21

So the presents went before him, but himself lodged that night in the camp.


<a id="orgf681cb2"></a>

## Genesis 32:22

And rising early, he took his two wives and his two handmaids, with his eleven sons, and passed over the ford of Jaboc.


<a id="org366b204"></a>

## Genesis 32:23

And when all things were brought over that belonged to him,


<a id="orgb82b75e"></a>

## Genesis 32:24

He remained alone; and behold, a man wrestled with him till morning.


<a id="orgdaeb931"></a>

## Genesis 32:25

And when he saw that he could not overcome him, he touched the sinew of his thigh, and forthwith it shrank.


<a id="org25eb8b6"></a>

## Genesis 32:26

And he said to him: Let me go, for it is break of day. He answered: I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.


<a id="org9b8d3a0"></a>

## Genesis 32:27

And he said: What is thy name? He answered: Jacob.


<a id="orgc370686"></a>

## Genesis 32:28

But he said: Thy name shall not be called Jacob, but Israel; for if thou hast been strong against God, how much more shalt thou prevail against men?


<a id="org9698d98"></a>

## Genesis 32:29

Jacob asked him: Tell me by what name art thou called? He answered: Why dost thou ask my name? And he blessed him in the same place.


<a id="org041efa3"></a>

## Genesis 32:30

And Jacob called the name of the place Phanuel, saying: I have seen God face to face, and my soul has been saved.


<a id="orga99a01a"></a>

## Genesis 32:31

And immediately the sun rose upon him, after he was past Phanuel; but he halted on his foot.


<a id="org3f7df3e"></a>

## Genesis 32:32

Therefore the children of Israel, unto this day, eat not the sinew, that shrank in Jacob&rsquo;s thigh: because he touched the sinew of his thigh and it shrank.


<a id="orgeaee18a"></a>

# Genesis 33


<a id="org0814057"></a>

## Genesis 33:1

And Jacob lifting up his eyes, saw Esau coming, and with him four hundred men: and he divided the children of Lia and of Rachel, and of the two handmaids.


<a id="orgc311564"></a>

## Genesis 33:2

And he put both the handmaids and their children foremost: and Lia and her children in the second place: and Rachel and Joseph last.


<a id="orgbad29ef"></a>

## Genesis 33:3

And he went forward and bowed down with his face to the ground seven times, until his brother came near.


<a id="orgbdc7f9e"></a>

## Genesis 33:4

Then Esau ran to meet his brother, and embraced him: and clasping him fast about the neck, and kissing him, wept.


<a id="org9866ca3"></a>

## Genesis 33:5

And lifting up his eyes, he saw the women and their children, and said: What mean these? And do they belong to thee? He answered: They are the children which God hath given to me, thy servant.


<a id="orgfe4d3f2"></a>

## Genesis 33:6

Then the handmaids and their children came near and bowed themselves.


<a id="orgb2b1880"></a>

## Genesis 33:7

Lia also, with her children, came near and bowed down in like manner; and last of all, Joseph and Rachel bowed down.


<a id="org4b19fb1"></a>

## Genesis 33:8

And Esau said: What are the droves that I met? He answered: That I might find favour before my lord.


<a id="org093279f"></a>

## Genesis 33:9

But he said: I have plenty, my brother, keep what is thine for thyself.


<a id="orgb7f5fdd"></a>

## Genesis 33:10

And Jacob said: Do not so I beseech thee, but if I have found favour in thy eyes, receive a little present at my hands: for I have seen thy face, as if I should have seen the countenance of God: be gracious to me,


<a id="org7925394"></a>

## Genesis 33:11

And take the blessing which I have brought thee, and which God hath given me, who giveth all things. He took it with much ado at his brother&rsquo;s earnest pressing him,


<a id="org116d404"></a>

## Genesis 33:12

And said: Let us go on together, and I will accompany thee in thy journey.


<a id="org2ba6eef"></a>

## Genesis 33:13

And Jacob said: My lord, thou knowest that I have with me tender children, and sheep, and kine with young: which if I should cause to be overdriven, in one day all the flocks will die.


<a id="orgeacdffd"></a>

## Genesis 33:14

May it please my lord to go before his servant: and I will follow softly after him, as I shall see my children to be able, until I come to my lord in Seir.


<a id="orge0f6d86"></a>

## Genesis 33:15

Esau answered: I beseech thee, that some of the people, at least, who are with me, may stay to accompany thee in the way. And he said: There is no necessity: I want nothing else but only to find favour, my lord, in thy sight.


<a id="org0ffacec"></a>

## Genesis 33:16

So Esau returned that day, the way that he came, to Seir.


<a id="org92489d0"></a>

## Genesis 33:17

And Jacob came to Socoth: where having built a house, and pitched tents, he called the name of the place Socoth, that is, Tents.


<a id="orgb4cb9e8"></a>

## Genesis 33:18

And he passed over to Salem, a city of the Sichemites, which is in the land of Chanaan, after he returned from Mesopotamia of Syria: and he dwelt by the town.


<a id="orga5e193a"></a>

## Genesis 33:19

And he bought that part of the field, in which he pitched his tents, of the children of Hemor, the father of Sichem, for a hundred lambs.


<a id="orgf5af271"></a>

## Genesis 33:20

And raising an altar there, he invoked upon it the most mighty God of Israel.


<a id="org0b8b649"></a>

# Genesis 34


<a id="org2ccf6c3"></a>

## Genesis 34:1

And Dina the daughter of Lia went out to see the women of that country.


<a id="orge7d9402"></a>

## Genesis 34:2

And when Sichem the son of Hemor the Hevite, the prince of that land, saw her, he was in love with her: and took her away, and lay with her, ravishing the virgin.


<a id="org6139b50"></a>

## Genesis 34:3

And his soul was fast knit unto her; and whereas she was sad, he comforted her with sweet words.


<a id="org37febce"></a>

## Genesis 34:4

And going to Hemor his father, he said: Get me this damsel to wife.


<a id="org6ecd06a"></a>

## Genesis 34:5

But when Jacob had heard this, his sons being absent, and employed in feeding the cattle, he held his peace till they came back.


<a id="orgdfb6cc2"></a>

## Genesis 34:6

And when Hemor the father of Sichem was come out to speak to Jacob,


<a id="org476ab3e"></a>

## Genesis 34:7

Behold his sons came from the field: and hearing what had passed, they were exceeding angry, because he had done a foul thing in Israel, and committed an unlawful act, in ravishing Jacob&rsquo;s daughter.


<a id="orgf30b889"></a>

## Genesis 34:8

And Hemor spoke to them: The soul of my son Sichem has a longing for your daughter: give her him to wife:


<a id="orga62755d"></a>

## Genesis 34:9

And let us contract marriages one with another: give us your daughters, and take you our daughters.


<a id="org5cf941f"></a>

## Genesis 34:10

And dwell with us: the land is at your command, till, trade, and possess it.


<a id="org28cced2"></a>

## Genesis 34:11

Sichem also said to her father and to her brethren: Let me find favour in your sight, and whatsoever you shall appoint I will give:


<a id="org1d881e0"></a>

## Genesis 34:12

Raise the dowry, and ask gifts, and I will gladly give what you shall demand: only give me this damsel to wife.


<a id="org92dcef3"></a>

## Genesis 34:13

The sons of Jacob answered Sichem and his father deceitfully, being enraged at the deflowering of their sister:


<a id="org7c9cbad"></a>

## Genesis 34:14

We cannot do what you demand, nor give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; which with us is unlawful and abominable.


<a id="orgacbac37"></a>

## Genesis 34:15

But in this we may be allied with you, if you will be like us, and all the male sex among you be circumcised:


<a id="org27d07e1"></a>

## Genesis 34:16

Then will we mutually give and take your daughters, and ours; and we will dwell with you, and will be one people:


<a id="org764b70f"></a>

## Genesis 34:17

But if you will not be circumcised, we will take our daughter and depart.


<a id="org94c5860"></a>

## Genesis 34:18

Their offer pleased Hemor, and Sichem, his son:


<a id="org395019e"></a>

## Genesis 34:19

And the young man made no delay, but forthwith fulfilled what was required: for he loved the damsel exceedingly, and he was the greatest man in all his father&rsquo;s house.


<a id="orgc1bdda7"></a>

## Genesis 34:20

And going into the gate of the city, they spoke to the people:


<a id="org5cc247f"></a>

## Genesis 34:21

These men are peaceable, and are willing to dwell with us: let them trade in the land, and till it, which being large and wide wanteth men to till it: we shall take their daughters for wives, and we will give them ours.


<a id="orgcc9b7db"></a>

## Genesis 34:22

One thing there is for which so great a good is deferred: We must circumcise every male among us, following the manner of the nation.


<a id="org016b88b"></a>

## Genesis 34:23

And their substance, and cattle, and all that they possess, shall be ours; only in this let us condescend, and by dwelling together, we shall make one people.


<a id="orgdb350fe"></a>

## Genesis 34:24

And they all agreed, and circumcised all the males.


<a id="org86fbf4e"></a>

## Genesis 34:25

And behold the third day, when the pain of the wound was greatest: two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, the brothers of Dina, taking their swords, entered boldly into the city and slew all the men.


<a id="orgcb44a18"></a>

## Genesis 34:26

And they killed also Hemor and Sichem, and took away their sister Dina out of Sichem&rsquo;s house.


<a id="orgb02f046"></a>

## Genesis 34:27

And when they were gone out, the other sons of Jacob came upon the slain; and plundered the city in revenge of the rape.


<a id="org0929fc6"></a>

## Genesis 34:28

And they took their sheep, and their herds, and their asses, wasting all they had in their houses and in their fields.


<a id="orgde2d1a2"></a>

## Genesis 34:29

And their children and wives they took captive.


<a id="orgea36fd7"></a>

## Genesis 34:30

And when they had boldly perpetrated these things, Jacob said to Simeon and Levi: You have troubled me, and made me hateful to the Chanaanites and Pherezites, the inhabitants of this land. We are few: they will gather themselves together and kill me; and both I, and my house shall be destroyed.


<a id="org1ffb262"></a>

## Genesis 34:31

They answered: Should they abuse our sister as a strumpet?


<a id="org25a160e"></a>

# Genesis 35


<a id="org1dc41b4"></a>

## Genesis 35:1

In the mean time God said to Jacob: Arise and go up to Bethel, and dwell there, and make there an altar to God, who appeared to thee when thou didst flee from Esau, thy brother.


<a id="org860ebc7"></a>

## Genesis 35:2

And Jacob having called together all his household, said: Cast away the strange gods that are among you, and be cleansed, and change your garments.


<a id="org7ce7947"></a>

## Genesis 35:3

Arise, and let us go up to Bethel, that we may make there an altar to God; who heard me in the day of my affliction, and accompained me in my journey.


<a id="orgc89921e"></a>

## Genesis 35:4

So they gave him all the strange gods they had, and the earrings which were in their ears: and he buried them under the turpentine tree, that is behind the city of Sichem.


<a id="orgb813356"></a>

## Genesis 35:5

And when they were departed, the terror of God fell upon all the cities round about, and they durst not pursue after them as they went away.


<a id="orgaa1da87"></a>

## Genesis 35:6

And Jacob came to Luza, which is in the land of Chanaan, surnamed Bethel: he and all the people that were with him.


<a id="org17ab524"></a>

## Genesis 35:7

And he built there an altar, and called the name of that place, The house of God: for there God appeared to him when he fled from his brother.


<a id="orgc942d02"></a>

## Genesis 35:8

At the same time Debora, the nurse of Rebecca, died, and was buried at the foot of Bethel, under an oak, and the name of that place was called, The oak of weeping.


<a id="org3735dd9"></a>

## Genesis 35:9

And God appeared again to Jacob, after he returned from Mesopotamia of Syria, and he blessed him,


<a id="org5d4381a"></a>

## Genesis 37:1

And Jacob dwelt in the land of Chanaan, wherein his father sojourned.


<a id="org6b17d58"></a>

## Genesis 37:2

And these are his generations: Joseph, when he was sixteen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren, being but a boy: and he was with the sons of Bala and of Zelpha his father&rsquo;s wives: and he accused his brethren to his father of a most wicked crime.


<a id="org9266c67"></a>

## Genesis 37:3

Now Israel loved Joseph above all his sons, because he had him in his old age: and he made him a coat of divers colours.


<a id="org76549db"></a>

## Genesis 37:4

And his brethren seeing that he was loved by his father, more than all his sons, hated hem, and could not speak peaceably to him.


<a id="orgb5d81cb"></a>

## Genesis 37:5

Now it fell out also that he told his brethren a dream, that he had dreamed: which occasioned them to hate him the more.


<a id="orgd586d42"></a>

## Genesis 37:6

And he said to them: Hear my dream which I dreamed.


<a id="org2f38b6a"></a>

## Genesis 37:7

I thought we were binding sheaves in the field: and my sheaf arose as it were, and stood, and your sheaves standing about bowed down before my sheaf.


<a id="orga20a4ab"></a>

## Genesis 37:8

His brethren answered: Shalt thou be our king? or shall we be subject to thy dominion? Therefore this matter of his dreams and words ministered nourishment to their envy and hatred.


<a id="org7b702db"></a>

## Genesis 37:9

He dreamed also another dream, which he told his brethren, saying: I saw in a dream, as it were the sun, and the moon, and eleven stars worshipping me.


<a id="org8726d07"></a>

## Genesis 37:10

And when he had told this to his father, and brethren, his father rebuked him and said: What meaneth this dream that thou hast dreamed? shall I and thy mother, and thy brethren worship thee upon the earth?


<a id="orgc70df95"></a>

## Genesis 37:11

His brethren therefore envied him: but his father considered the thing with himself.


<a id="org0d8bd53"></a>

## Genesis 37:12

And when his brethren abode in Sechem, feeding their father&rsquo;s flocks,


<a id="org3c308c0"></a>

## Genesis 37:13

Israel said to him: Thy brethren feed the sheep in Sichem: come, I will send thee to them. And when he answered:


<a id="org91f0093"></a>

## Genesis 37:14

I am ready: he said to him: Go, and see if all things be well with thy brethren, and the cattle: and bring me word again what is doing. So being sent from the vale of Hebron, he came to Sichem:


<a id="org22fa304"></a>

## Genesis 37:15

And a man found him there wandering in the field, and asked what he sought.


<a id="org00ece14"></a>

## Genesis 37:16

But he answered: I seek my brethren, tell me where they feed the flocks.


<a id="org10a2031"></a>

## Genesis 37:17

And the man said to him: They are departed from this place: for I heard them say: Let us go to Dothain. And Joseph went forward after his brethren, and found them in Dothain.


<a id="orge7fdafb"></a>

## Genesis 37:18

And when they saw him afar off, before he came nigh them, they thought to kill him:


<a id="org9acc8c7"></a>

## Genesis 37:19

And said one to another: Behold the dreamer cometh.


<a id="org89f6a2b"></a>

## Genesis 37:20

Come, let us kill him, and cast him into some old pit: and we will say: Some evil beast hath devoured him: and then it shall appear what his dreams avail him:


<a id="org5ef78d4"></a>

## Genesis 37:21

And Ruben hearing this, endeavoured to deliver him out of their hands, and said:


<a id="org7d9b2a2"></a>

## Genesis 37:22

Do not take away his life, nor shed his blood: but cast him into this pit, that is in the wilderness, and keep your hands harmless: now he said this, being desirous to deliver him out of their hands and to restore him to his father.


<a id="orgd6ed96a"></a>

## Genesis 37:23

And as soon as he came to his brethren, they forthwith stript him of his outside coat, that was of divers colours:


<a id="org3f2b36d"></a>

## Genesis 37:24

And cast him into an old pit where there was not water.


<a id="org7dfc64a"></a>

## Genesis 37:25

And sitting down to eat bread, they saw some Ismaelites on their way coming from Galaad, with their camels, carrying spices, and balm, and myrrh to Egypt.


<a id="org7fead49"></a>

## Genesis 37:26

And Juda said to his brethren: What will it profit us to kill our brother, and conceal his blood?


<a id="org3d3be2e"></a>

## Genesis 37:27

It is better that he be sold to the Ismaelites, and that our hands be not defiled: for he is our brother and our flesh. His brethren agreed to his words.


<a id="org02ad240"></a>

## Genesis 37:28

And when the Madianite merchants passed by, they drew him out of the pit, and sold him to the Ismaelites, for twenty pieces of silver: and they led him into Egypt.


<a id="orgda7e9ec"></a>

## Genesis 37:29

And Ruben returning to the pit, found not the boy:


<a id="orgfd96eaa"></a>

## Genesis 37:30

And rending his garments he went to his brethren, and said: The boy doth not appear, and whither shall I go?


<a id="org9e9e5dc"></a>

## Genesis 37:31

And they took his coat, and dipped it in the blood of a kid, which they had killed:


<a id="orgadf69d7"></a>

## Genesis 37:32

Sending some to carry it to their father, and to say: This we have found: see whether it be thy son&rsquo;s coat, or not.


<a id="org97594db"></a>

## Genesis 37:33

And the father acknowledging it, said: It is my son&rsquo;s coat, an evil wild beast hath eaten him, a beast hath devoured Joseph.


<a id="org5d733f0"></a>

## Genesis 37:34

And tearing his garments, he put on sackcloth, mourning for his son a long time.


<a id="org979adb0"></a>

## Genesis 37:35

And all his children being gathered together to comfort their father in his sorrow, he would not receive comfort, but said: I will go down to my son into hell, mourning. And whilst he continued weeping,


<a id="org2b98e96"></a>

## Genesis 37:36

The Madianites sold Joseph in Egypt to Putiphar, an eunuch of Pharao, captain of the soldiers.


<a id="orga836ce3"></a>

# Genesis 38


<a id="org03287b2"></a>

## Genesis 38:1

At that time Juda went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Odollamite, named Hiras.


<a id="orgcbd86f6"></a>

## Genesis 38:2

And he saw there the daughter of a man of Chanaan, called Sue: and taking her to wife, he went in unto her.


<a id="org0d5996f"></a>

## Genesis 38:3

And she conceived, and bore a son, and called his name Her.


<a id="org5a41d08"></a>

## Genesis 38:4

And conceiving again, she bore a son, and called him Onan.


<a id="orgc62e9f4"></a>

## Genesis 38:5

She bore also a third: whom she called Sela. After whose birth, she ceased to bear any more.


<a id="org9c3f59f"></a>

## Genesis 38:6

And Juda took a wife for Her, his first born, whose name was Thamar.


<a id="org581cf2d"></a>

## Genesis 38:7

And Her, the first born of Juda, was wicked in the sight of the Lord: and was slain by him.


<a id="orgd02da2d"></a>

## Genesis 38:8

Juda, therefore, said to Onan his son: Go in to thy brother&rsquo;s wife and marry her, that thou mayst raise seed to thy brother.


<a id="org62881c3"></a>

## Genesis 38:9

He knowing that the children should not be his, when he went in to his brother&rsquo;s wife, he spilled his seed upon the ground, lest children should be born in his brother&rsquo;s name.


<a id="org051c415"></a>

## Genesis 38:10

And therefore the Lord slew him, because he did a detestable thing:


<a id="org7dad734"></a>

## Genesis 38:11

Wherefore Juda said to Thamar his daughter-in-law: Remain a widow in thy father&rsquo;s house, till Sela my son grow up: for he was afraid lest he also might die, as his brethren did. She went her way, and dwelt in her father&rsquo;s house.


<a id="orgb943e9e"></a>

## Genesis 38:12

And after many days were past: the daughter of Sue the wife of Juda died: and when he had taken comfort after his mourning, he went up to Thamnas, to the shearers of his sheep, he and Hiras the Odollamite, the shepherd of his flock.


<a id="org909be67"></a>

## Genesis 38:13

And it was told Thamar that her father-in-law was come up to Thamnas to shear his sheep.


<a id="orgf21d994"></a>

## Genesis 38:14

And she put off the garments of her widowhood, and took a veil: and changing her dress, sat in the cross way, that leadeth to Thamnas: because Sela was grown up, and she had not been married to him.


<a id="org5301cc6"></a>

## Genesis 38:15

When Juda saw her, he thought she was a harlot: for she had covered her face, lest she should be known.


<a id="org9764f16"></a>

## Genesis 38:16

And going to her, he said: Suffer me to lie with thee: for he knew her not to be his daughter-in-law. And she answered: What wilt thou give me to enjoy my company?


<a id="org1a8b7fd"></a>

## Genesis 38:17

He said: I will send thee a kid out of the flock. And when she said again: I will suffer what thou wilt, if thou give me a pledge, till thou send what thou promisest.


<a id="org12190cd"></a>

## Genesis 38:18

Juda said: What wilt thou have for a pledge? She answered: Thy ring and bracelet, and the staff which thou holdest in thy hand. The woman therefore at one copulation conceived.


<a id="orgfc41130"></a>

## Genesis 38:19

And she arose and went her way: and putting off the apparel which she had taken, put on the garments of her widowhood.


<a id="org4013d80"></a>

## Genesis 38:20

And Juda sent a kid by his shepherd, the Odollamite, that he might receive the pledge again, which he had given to the woman: but he, not finding her,


<a id="org6ae204e"></a>

## Genesis 38:21

Asked the men of that place: Where is the woman that sat in the cross way? And when they all made answer: There was no harlot in this place,


<a id="org726f058"></a>

## Genesis 38:22

He returned to Juda, and said to him: I have not found her; moreover, the men of that place said to me, that there never sat a harlot there.


<a id="orgc6dd89e"></a>

## Genesis 38:23

Juda said: Let her take it to herself, surely she cannot charge us with a lie, I sent the kid which I promised: and thou didst not find her.


<a id="org842ec6a"></a>

## Genesis 38:24

And behold, after three months, they told Juda, saying: Thamar, thy daughter-in-law, hath played the harlot, and she appeareth to have a big belly. And Juda said: Bring her out that she may be burnt.


<a id="org3b0d9df"></a>

## Genesis 38:25

But when she was led to execution, she sent to her father in law, saying: By the man, to whom these things belong, I am with child. See whose ring, and bracelet, and staff this is.


<a id="orgab5726d"></a>

## Genesis 38:26

But he acknowledging the gifts, said: She is juster than I: because I did not give her to Sela, my son. However he knew her no more.


<a id="org15250ac"></a>

## Genesis 38:27

And when she was ready to be brought to bed, there appeared twins in her womb: and in the very delivery of the infants, one put forth a hand, whereon the midwife tied a scarlet thread, saying:


<a id="orgc58cb4e"></a>

## Genesis 38:28

This shall come forth the first.


<a id="org0e24d7a"></a>

## Genesis 38:29

But he drawing back his hand, the other came forth: and the woman said: Why is the partition divided for thee? and therefore called his name Phares.


<a id="org37f5b5d"></a>

## Genesis 38:30

Afterwards his brother came out, on whose hand was the scarlet thread: and she called his name Zara.


<a id="orge0abdb9"></a>

# Genesis 39


<a id="orgff4671f"></a>

## Genesis 39:1

And Joseph was brought into Egypt, and Putiphar, an eunuch of Pharao, chief captain of the army, an Egyptian, bought him of the Ismaelites, by whom he was brought.


<a id="orgcc9cd66"></a>

## Genesis 39:2

And the Lord was with him, and he was a prosperous man in all things: and he dwelt in his master&rsquo;s house:


<a id="orgc0cf2ad"></a>

## Genesis 39:3

Who knew very well that the Lord was with him, and made all that he did to prosper in his hand.


<a id="org4135ebc"></a>

## Genesis 39:4

And Joseph found favour in the sight of his master, and ministered to him: and being set over all by him, he governed the house committed to him, and all things that were delivered to him:


<a id="orgb22ced8"></a>

## Genesis 39:5

And the Lord blessed the house of the Egyptian for Joseph&rsquo;s sake, and multiplied all his substance, both at home and in the fields.


<a id="orgb5f7803"></a>

## Genesis 39:6

Neither knew he any other thing, but the bread which he ate. And Joseph was of a beautiful countenance, and comely to behold.


<a id="org5cbd2cb"></a>

## Genesis 39:7

And after many days, his mistress cast her eyes on Joseph, and said: Lie with me.


<a id="orge77e86c"></a>

## Genesis 39:8

But he in no wise consenting to that wicked act said to her: Behold, my master hath delivered all things to me, and knoweth not what he hath in his own house:


<a id="org10f1852"></a>

## Genesis 39:9

Neither is there any thing which is not in my power, or that he hath not delivered to me, but thee, who art his wife; how then can I do this wicked thing, and sin against my God?


<a id="orgc045d20"></a>

## Genesis 39:10

With such words as these day by day, both the woman was importunate with the young man, and he refused the adultery.


<a id="org21978fe"></a>

## Genesis 39:11

Now it happened on a certain day, that Joseph went into the house, and was doing some business, without any man with him:


<a id="org4cc6a1a"></a>

## Genesis 39:12

And she catching the skirt of his garment, said: Lie with me. But he leaving the garment in her hand, fled, and went out.


<a id="orgfa97cad"></a>

## Genesis 39:13

And when the woman saw the garment in her hands, and herself disregarded,


<a id="org1260436"></a>

## Genesis 39:14

She called to her the men of her house, and said to them: See, he hath brought in a Hebrew, to abuse us: he came in to me, to lie with me; and when I cried out,


<a id="org771d8a6"></a>

## Genesis 39:15

And he heard my voice, he left the garment that I held, and got him out.


<a id="org024852d"></a>

## Genesis 39:16

For a proof therefore of her fidelity, she kept the garment, and shewed it to her husband when he returned home:


<a id="orge846efb"></a>

## Genesis 39:17

And said: The Hebrew servant, whom thou hast brought, came to me to abuse me.


<a id="org56aba87"></a>

## Genesis 39:18

And when he heard me cry, he left the garment which I held, and fled out.


<a id="orgf983b86"></a>

## Genesis 39:19

His master hearing these things, and giving too much credit to his wife&rsquo;s words, was very angry,


<a id="orgf958bc2"></a>

## Genesis 39:20

And cast Joseph into the prison, where the king&rsquo;s prisoners were kept, and he was there shut up.


<a id="org66f578d"></a>

## Genesis 39:21

But the Lord was with Joseph, and having mercy upon him gave him favour in the sight of the chief keeper of the prison:


<a id="orge372ea2"></a>

## Genesis 39:22

Who delivered into his hand all the prisoners that were kept in custody: and whatsoever was done, was under him.


<a id="org542d354"></a>

## Genesis 39:23

Neither did he himself know any thing, having committed all things to him: for the Lord was with him, and made all that he did to prosper.


<a id="org624b6b8"></a>

# Genesis 40


<a id="org8039fab"></a>

## Genesis 40:1

After this, it came to pass, that two eunuchs, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, offended their lord.


<a id="org369514c"></a>

## Genesis 40:2

And Pharao being angry with them, (now the one was chief butler, the other chief baker,)


<a id="org1cc2db2"></a>

## Genesis 40:3

He sent them to the prison of the commander of the soldiers, in which Joseph also was prisoner.


<a id="org00f0506"></a>

## Genesis 40:4

But the keeper of the prison delivered them to Joseph, and he served them. Some little time passed, and they were kept in custody.


<a id="orga472ad9"></a>

## Genesis 40:5

And they both dreamed a dream the same night, according to the interpretation agreeing to themselves:


<a id="org30c4bcd"></a>

## Genesis 40:6

And when Joseph was come into them in the morning, and saw them sad,


<a id="orgdd6f104"></a>

## Genesis 40:7

He asked them, saying: Why is your countenance sadder today than usual?


<a id="orga166e01"></a>

## Genesis 40:8

They answered: We have dreamed a dream, and there is nobody to interpret it to us. And Joseph said to them: Doth not interpretation belong to God? Tell me what you have dreamed:


<a id="orgb8d14a2"></a>

## Genesis 40:9

The chief butler first told his dream: I saw before me a vine,


<a id="org5c6d9c1"></a>

## Genesis 40:10

On which were three branches, which by little and little sent out buds, and after the blossoms brought forth ripe grapes:


<a id="org1a48375"></a>

## Genesis 40:11

And the cup of Pharao was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them into the cup which I held, and I gave the cup to Pharao.


<a id="org84520d2"></a>

## Genesis 40:12

Joseph answered: This is the interpretation of the dream: The three branches, are yet three days:


<a id="org1a38dc4"></a>

## Genesis 40:13

After which Pharao will remember thy service, and will restore thee to thy former place: and thou shalt present him the cup according to thy office, as before thou was wont to do.


<a id="org8fb5e04"></a>

## Genesis 40:14

Only remember me when it shall be well with thee, and do me this kindness: to put Pharao in mind to take me out of this prison:


<a id="orga13d522"></a>

## Genesis 40:15

For I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews, and here without any fault was cast into the dungeon.


<a id="org83102bb"></a>

## Genesis 40:16

The chief baker seeing that he had wisely interpreted the dream, said: I also dreamed a dream, That I had three baskets of meal upon my head:


<a id="org03cc0b2"></a>

## Genesis 40:17

And that in one basket which was uppermost, I carried all meats that are made by the art of baking, and that the birds ate out of it.


<a id="org8605823"></a>

## Genesis 40:18

Joseph answered: This is the interpretation of the dream: The three baskets, are yet three days:


<a id="org28b4336"></a>

## Genesis 40:19

After which Pharao will take thy head from thee, and hang thee on a cross, and the birds shall tear thy flesh.


<a id="orgc4c21d2"></a>

## Genesis 40:20

The third day after this was the birthday of Pharao: and he made a great feast for his servants, and at the banquet remembered the chief butler, and the chief baker.


<a id="org90c524f"></a>

## Genesis 40:21

And he restored the one to his place, to present him the cup:


<a id="orgfd4f857"></a>

## Genesis 40:22

The other he hanged on a gibbet, that the truth of the interpreter might be shewn.


<a id="org28f3901"></a>

## Genesis 40:23

But the chief butler, when things prospered with him, forgot his interpreter.


<a id="org7490d41"></a>

# Genesis 41


<a id="orgef0ebc8"></a>

## Genesis 41:1

After two years Pharao had a dream. He thought he stood by the river,


<a id="org30d2bc3"></a>

## Genesis 41:2

Out of which came up seven kine, very beautiful and fat: and they fed in marshy places.


<a id="orgd7ca47b"></a>

## Genesis 41:3

Other seven also came up out of the river, ill-favoured, and lean fleshed: and they fed on the very bank of the river, in green places:


<a id="orga9160af"></a>

## Genesis 41:4

And they devoured them, whose bodies were very beautiful and well conditioned. So Pharao awoke.


<a id="org680bb01"></a>

## Genesis 41:5

He slept again, and dreamed another dream: Seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk full and fair:


<a id="orgaee69ad"></a>

## Genesis 41:6

Then seven other ears sprung up thin and blasted,


<a id="org05d0b37"></a>

## Genesis 41:7

And devoured all the beauty of the former. Pharao awaked after his rest:


<a id="orgaaae763"></a>

## Genesis 41:8

And when morning was come, being struck with fear, he sent to all the interpreters of Egypt, and to all the wise men: and they being called for, he told them his dream, and there was not any one that could interpret it.


<a id="org9e8bd88"></a>

## Genesis 41:9

Then at length the chief butler remembering, said: I confess my sin:


<a id="org72ea348"></a>

## Genesis 41:10

The king being angry with his servants, commanded me and the chief baker to be cast into the prison of the captain of the soldiers.


<a id="orgae41224"></a>

## Genesis 41:11

Where in one night both of us dreamed a dream foreboding things to come.


<a id="org267208d"></a>

## Genesis 41:12

There was there a young man a Hebrew, servant to the same captain of the soldiers: to whom we told our dreams,


<a id="orgcba60a2"></a>

## Genesis 41:13

And we heard what afterwards the event of the thing proved to be so. For I was restored to my office: and he was hanged upon a gibbet.


<a id="orgcc78b6e"></a>

## Genesis 41:14

Forthwith at the king&rsquo;s command Joseph was brought out of the prison, and they shaved him: and changing his apparel brought him in to him.


<a id="org778be75"></a>

## Genesis 41:15

And he said to him: I have dreamed dreams, and there is no one that can expound them: Now I have heard that thou art very wise at interpreting them:


<a id="orga37a35e"></a>

## Genesis 41:16

Joseph answered: Without me, God shall give Pharao a prosperous answer.


<a id="orge577918"></a>

## Genesis 41:17

So Pharao told what he had dreamed: Methought I stood upon the bank of the river,


<a id="org3bde816"></a>

## Genesis 41:18

And seven kine came up out of the river, exceeding beautiful and full of flesh: and they grazed on green places in a marshy pasture.


<a id="org8761214"></a>

## Genesis 41:19

And behold, there followed these, other seven kine, so very ill-favoured and lean, that I never saw the like in the land of Egypt:


<a id="orgfad659a"></a>

## Genesis 41:20

And they devoured and consumed the former,


<a id="org4c42740"></a>

## Genesis 41:21

And yet gave no mark of their being full: but were as lean and ill-favoured as before. I awoke, and then fell asleep again,


<a id="org5e78d30"></a>

## Genesis 41:22

And dreamed a dream: Seven ears of corn grew up upon one stalk, full and very fair.


<a id="orgba86c0b"></a>

## Genesis 41:23

Other seven also thin and blasted, sprung of the stalk:


<a id="orgd975edb"></a>

## Genesis 41:24

And they devoured the beauty of the former: I told this dream to the conjecturers, and there is no man that can expound it.


<a id="org99be6bb"></a>

## Genesis 41:25

Joseph answered: The king&rsquo;s dream is one: God hath shewn to Pharao what he is about to do.


<a id="orgaa3b8e1"></a>

## Genesis 41:26

The seven beautiful kine, and the seven full ears, are seven years of plenty: and both contain the same meaning of the dream.


<a id="org3f58998"></a>

## Genesis 41:27

And the seven lean and thin kine that came up after them, and the seven thin ears that were blasted with the burning wind, are seven years of famine to come:


<a id="org55d10bb"></a>

## Genesis 41:28

Which shall be fulfilled in this order.


<a id="orgaa37162"></a>

## Genesis 41:29

Behold, there shall come seven years of great plenty in the whole land of Egypt:


<a id="orgd0e72a4"></a>

## Genesis 41:30

After which shall follow other seven years of so great scarcity, that all the abundance before shall be forgotten: for the famine shall consume all the land,


<a id="org622a956"></a>

## Genesis 41:31

And the greatness of the scarcity shall destroy the greatness of the plenty.


<a id="org75c0910"></a>

## Genesis 41:32

And for that thou didst see the second time a dream pertaining to the same thing: it is a token of the certainty, and that the word of God cometh to pass, and is fulfilled speedily.


<a id="orgc49fd58"></a>

## Genesis 41:33

Now therefore let the king provide a wise and industrious man, and make him ruler over the land of Egypt:


<a id="orgf9f029c"></a>

## Genesis 41:34

That he may appoint overseers over all the countries: and gather into barns the fifth part of the fruits, during the seven fruitful years,


<a id="orga815960"></a>

## Genesis 41:35

That shall now presently ensue: and let all the corn be laid up, under Pharao&rsquo;s hands, and be reserved in the cities.


<a id="orgfbd7a11"></a>

## Genesis 41:36

And let it be in readiness, against the famine of seven years to come, which shall oppress Egypt, and the land shall not be consumed with scarcity.


<a id="orga02e019"></a>

## Genesis 41:37

The counsel pleased Pharao, and all his servants.


<a id="org154bc11"></a>

## Genesis 41:38

And he said to them: Can we find such another man, that is full of the spirit of God?


<a id="orged95f5e"></a>

## Genesis 41:39

He said therefore to Joseph: Seeing God hath shewn thee all that thou hast said, can I find one wiser and one like unto thee?


<a id="org33b5f81"></a>

## Genesis 41:40

Thou shalt be over my house, and at the commandment of thy mouth all the people shall obey: only in the kingly throne will I be above thee.


<a id="org9cd842c"></a>

## Genesis 41:41

And again Pharao said to Joseph: Behold, I have appointed thee over the whole land of Egypt.


<a id="org8279fee"></a>

## Genesis 41:42

And he took his ring from his own hand, and gave it into his hand: and he put upon him a robe of silk, and put a chain of gold about his neck.


<a id="orge14c54b"></a>

## Genesis 41:43

And he made him go up into his second chariot, the crier proclaiming that all should bow their knee before him, and that they should know he was made governor over the whole land of Egypt.


<a id="orgaa1d18c"></a>

## Genesis 41:44

And the king said to Joseph: I am Pharao: without thy commandment no man shall move hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.


<a id="orgdeb6025"></a>

## Genesis 41:45

And he turned his name, and called him in the Egyptian tongue the saviour of the world. And he gave him to wife Aseneth, the daughter of Putiphare, priest of Heliopolis. Then Joseph went out to the land of Egypt.


<a id="orgea10437"></a>

## Genesis 41:46

(Now he was thirty years old when he stood before king Pharao), and he went round all the countries of Egypt.


<a id="orga441115"></a>

## Genesis 41:47

And the fruitfulness of the seven years came: and the corn being bound up into sheaves, was gathered together into the barns of Egypt.


<a id="org4a94ea3"></a>

## Genesis 41:48

And all the abundance of grain was laid up in every city.


<a id="org452fa58"></a>

## Genesis 41:49

And there was so great abundance of wheat, that it was equal to the sand of the sea, and the plenty exceeded measure.


<a id="orga2f4b48"></a>

## Genesis 41:50

And before the famine came, Joseph had two sons born: whom Aseneth, the daughter of Putiphare, priest of Heliopolis, bore unto him.


<a id="org1166c20"></a>

## Genesis 41:51

And he called the name of the firstborn Manasses, saying: God hath made me to forget all my labours, and my father&rsquo;s house.


<a id="orge9bf868"></a>

## Genesis 41:52

And he named the second Ephraim, saying: God hath made me to grow in the land of my poverty.


<a id="orga33c6a9"></a>

## Genesis 41:53

Now when the seven years of plenty that had been in Egypt were passed:


<a id="orge889028"></a>

## Genesis 41:54

The seven years of scarcity, which Joseph had foretold, began to come: and the famine prevailed in the whole world, but there was bread in all the land of Egypt.


<a id="org0748563"></a>

## Genesis 41:55

And when there also they began to be famished, the people cried to Pharao, for food. And he said to them: Go to Joseph: and do all that he shall say to you.


<a id="org31ace86"></a>

## Genesis 41:56

And the famine increased daily in all the land: and Joseph opened all the barns, and sold to the Egyptians: for the famine had oppressed them also.


<a id="orgff643f9"></a>

## Genesis 41:57

And all provinces came into Egypt, to buy food, and to seek some relief of their want.


<a id="orgd35752b"></a>

# Genesis 42


<a id="org0f4be43"></a>

## Genesis 42:1

And Jacob hearing that food was sold in Egypt, said to his sons: Why are ye careless?


<a id="orgc631760"></a>

## Genesis 42:2

I have heard that wheat is sold in Egypt: Go ye down, and buy us necessaries, that we may live, and not be consumed with want.


<a id="orgf82a49c"></a>

## Genesis 42:3

So the ten brethren of Joseph went down, to buy corn in Egypt:


<a id="orgce85751"></a>

## Genesis 42:4

Whilst Benjamin was kept at home by Jacob, who said to his brethren: Lest perhaps he take any harm in the journey.


<a id="orga7d161c"></a>

## Genesis 42:5

And they entered into the land of Egypt with others that went to buy. For the famine was in the land of Chanaan.


<a id="org5426a9d"></a>

## Genesis 42:6

And Joseph was governor in the land of Egypt, and corn was sold by his direction to the people. And when his brethren had bowed down to him,


<a id="org2baae1b"></a>

## Genesis 42:7

And he knew them, he spoke as it were to strangers, somewhat roughly, asking them: Whence came you? They answered: From the land of Chanaan, to buy necessaries of life.


<a id="org900fecb"></a>

## Genesis 42:8

And though he knew his brethren, he was not known by them.


<a id="orge04ae77"></a>

## Genesis 42:9

And remembering the dreams, which formerly he had dreamed, he said to them: You are spies. You are come to view the weaker parts of the land.


<a id="org59c1a25"></a>

## Genesis 42:10

But they said: It is not so, my lord; but thy servants are come to buy food.


<a id="orgfe1a31e"></a>

## Genesis 42:11

We are all the sons of one man: we are come as peaceable men, neither do thy servants go about any evil.


<a id="org7fb1e7a"></a>

## Genesis 42:12

And he answered them: It is otherwise: you are come to consider the unfenced parts of this land.


<a id="orgd77daf7"></a>

## Genesis 42:13

But they said: We thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Chanaan: the youngest is with our father, the other is not living.


<a id="org30462d9"></a>

## Genesis 42:14

He saith, This is it that I said: You are spies.


<a id="org6851ca6"></a>

## Genesis 42:15

I shall now presently try what you are: by the health of Pharao, you shall not depart hence, until your youngest brother come.


<a id="orgc91f487"></a>

## Genesis 42:16

Send one of you to fetch him: and you shall be in prison, till what you have said be proved, whether it be true or false: or else by the health of Pharao you are spies.


<a id="org1316afc"></a>

## Genesis 42:17

So he put them in prison three days.


<a id="orga872bc4"></a>

## Genesis 42:18

And the third day he brought them out of prison, and said: Do as I have said, and you shall live: for I fear God.


<a id="orgaf3b2d3"></a>

## Genesis 42:19

If you be peaceable men, let one of your brethren be bound in prison: and go ye your ways, and carry the corn that you have bought, unto your houses.


<a id="org6f771ab"></a>

## Genesis 42:20

And bring your youngest brother to me, that I may find your words to be true, and you may not die. They did as he had said.


<a id="orge45814d"></a>

## Genesis 42:21

And they talked one to another: We deserve to suffer these things, because we have sinned against our brother, seeing the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear: therefore is this affliction come upon us.


<a id="orgfab94e7"></a>

## Genesis 42:22

And Ruben, one of them, said: Did not I say to you: Do not sin against the boy; and you would not hear me? Behold his blood is required.


<a id="org6aecf0b"></a>

## Genesis 42:23

And they knew not that Joseph understood, because he spoke to them by an interpreter.


<a id="orgec7fbc9"></a>

## Genesis 42:24

And he turned himself away a little while, and wept: and returning, he spoke to them.


<a id="orge119052"></a>

## Genesis 42:25

And taking Simeon, and binding him in their presence, he commanded his servants to fill their sacks with wheat, and to put every man&rsquo;s money again in their sacks, and to give them besides provisions for the way: and they did so.


<a id="org583b48c"></a>

## Genesis 42:26

But they having loaded their asses with the corn went their way.


<a id="orgee33c9a"></a>

## Genesis 42:27

And one of them opening his sack, to give his beast provender in the inn, saw the money in the sack&rsquo;s mouth,


<a id="orgfbd574e"></a>

## Genesis 42:28

And said to his brethren: My money is given me again; behold it is in the sack. And they were astonished, and troubled, and said to one another: What is this that God hath done unto us?


<a id="orgf007986"></a>

## Genesis 42:29

And they came to Jacob their father in the land of Chanaan, and they told him all things that had befallen them, saying:


<a id="org5e60ab0"></a>

## Genesis 42:30

The lord of the land spoke roughly to us, and took us to be spies of the country.


<a id="orgc64a972"></a>

## Genesis 42:31

And we answered him: We are peaceable men, and we mean no plot.


<a id="orgefef8bf"></a>

## Genesis 42:32

We are twelve brethren born of one father: one is not living, the youngest is with our father in the land of Chanaan.


<a id="org8aa33ab"></a>

## Genesis 42:33

And he said to us: Hereby shall I know that you are peaceable men: Leave one of your brethren with me, and take ye necessary provision for your houses, and go your ways,


<a id="org2854316"></a>

## Genesis 42:34

And bring your youngest brother to me, that I may know you are not spies: and you may receive this man again, that is kept in prison: and afterwards may have leave to buy what you will.


<a id="org2fcf8c7"></a>

## Genesis 42:35

When they had told this, they poured out their corn, and every man found his money tied in the mouth of his sack: and all being astonished together,


<a id="org123ac19"></a>

## Genesis 42:36

Their father Jacob said: You have made me to be without children: Joseph is not living, Simeon is kept in bonds, and Benjamin you will take away: all these evils are fallen upon me.


<a id="org0acdc31"></a>

## Genesis 42:37

And Ruben answered him: Kill my two sons, if I bring him not again to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will restore him to thee.


<a id="org051f478"></a>

## Genesis 42:38

But he said: My son shall not go down with you: his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if any mischief befall him in the land to which you go, you will bring down my grey hairs with sorrow to hell.


<a id="org95dad6f"></a>

# Genesis 43


<a id="org7cc4c3d"></a>

## Genesis 43:1

In the mean time the famine was heavy upon all the land.


<a id="org7c219d4"></a>

## Genesis 43:2

And when they had eaten up all the corn, which they had brought out of Egypt, Jacob said to his sons: Go again, and buy us a little food.


<a id="orgc77f444"></a>

## Genesis 43:3

Juda answered: The man declared unto us with the attestation of an oath, saying: You shall not see my face, unless you bring your youngest brother with you.


<a id="orgb183169"></a>

## Genesis 43:4

If therefore thou wilt send him with us, we will set out together, and will buy necessaries for thee.


<a id="org3d2b9d6"></a>

## Genesis 43:5

But if thou wilt not, we will not go: for the man, as we have often said, declared unto us, saying: You shall not see my face without your youngest brother.


<a id="org6e11078"></a>

## Genesis 43:6

Israel said to them: You have done this for my misery, in that you told him you had also another brother.


<a id="org39e901d"></a>

## Genesis 43:7

But they answered: The man asked us in order concerning our kindred: if our father lived: if we had a brother: and we answered him regularly, according to what he demanded: could we know that he would say: Bring hither your brother with you?


<a id="org48e07d2"></a>

## Genesis 43:8

And Juda said to his father: Send the boy with me, that we may set forward, and may live: lest both we and our children perish.


<a id="org5b92762"></a>

## Genesis 43:9

I take the boy upon me, require him at my hand: unless I bring him again, and restore him to thee, I will be guilty of sin against thee for ever.


<a id="org3545fe7"></a>

## Genesis 43:10

If delay had not been made, we had been here again the second time.


<a id="orge990b92"></a>

## Genesis 43:11

Then Israel said to them: If it must needs be so, do what you will: take of the best fruits of the land in your vessels, and carry down presents to the man, a little balm, and honey, and storax, myrrh, turpentine, and almonds.


<a id="orgdd77850"></a>

## Genesis 43:12

And take with you double money, and carry back what you found in your sacks, lest perhaps it was done by mistake.


<a id="orgd1bd4f7"></a>

## Genesis 43:13

And take also your brother, and go to the man.


<a id="orgb7cc444"></a>

## Genesis 43:14

And may my almighty God make him favourable to you: and send back with you your brother, whom he keepeth, and this Benjamin: and as for me I shall be desolate without children.


<a id="org0809c9f"></a>

## Genesis 43:15

So the men took the presents, and double money, and Benjamin: and went down into Egypt, and stood before Joseph.


<a id="orgd2815e9"></a>

## Genesis 43:16

And when he had seen them, and Benjamin with them, he commanded the steward of his house, saying: Bring in the men into the house, and kill victims, and prepare a feast: because they shall eat with me at noon.


<a id="org97fbe4f"></a>

## Genesis 43:17

He did as he was commanded, and brought the men into the house.

## Genesis 43:18

And they being much afraid, said there one to another: Because of the money, which we carried back the first time in our sacks, we are brought in: that he may bring upon us a false accusation, and by violence make slaves of us and our asses.


<a id="orgd1d591e"></a>

## Genesis 43:19

Wherefore, going up to the steward of the house, at the door,


<a id="orgca2fb89"></a>

## Genesis 43:20

They said: Sir, we desire thee to hear us. We came down once before to buy food:


<a id="orgeb9268b"></a>

## Genesis 43:21

And when we had bought, and were come to the inn, we opened our sacks, and found our money in the mouths of the sacks: which we have now brought again in the same weight.


<a id="org382101a"></a>

## Genesis 43:22

And we have brought other money besides, to buy what we want: we cannot tell who put it in our bags.


<a id="org38561d8"></a>

## Genesis 43:23

But he answered: Peace be with you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks. For the money, which you gave me, I have for good. And he brought Simeon out to them.


<a id="org606032d"></a>

## Genesis 43:24

And having brought them into the house, he fetched water, and they washed their feet, and he gave provender to their asses.


<a id="org5184602"></a>

## Genesis 43:25

But they made ready the presents, against Joseph came at noon: for they had heard that they should eat bread there.


<a id="org60c371a"></a>

## Genesis 43:26

Then Joseph came in to his house, and they offered him the presents, holding them in their hands; and they bowed down with their face to the ground.


<a id="org25e41e3"></a>

## Genesis 43:27

But he courteously saluting them again, asked them, saying: Is the old man your father in health, of whom you told me? Is he yet living?


<a id="org17be50f"></a>

## Genesis 43:28

And they answered: Thy servant our father, is in health; he is yet living. And bowing themselves, they made obeisance to him.


<a id="org70dbaa8"></a>

## Genesis 43:29

And Joseph lifting up his eyes, saw Benjamin, his brother by the same mother, and said: Is this your young brother, of whom you told me? And he said: God be gracious to thee, my son.


<a id="org42a0358"></a>

## Genesis 43:30

And he made haste, because his heart was moved upon his brother, and tears gushed out: and going into his chamber, he wept.


<a id="org446fb8f"></a>

## Genesis 43:31

And when he had washed his face, coming out again, he refrained himself, and said: Set bread on the table.


<a id="orgf520d2f"></a>

## Genesis 43:32

And when it was set on, for Joseph apart, and for his brethren apart, for the Egyptians also that ate with him apart, (for it is unlawful for the Egyptians to eat with the Hebrews, and they think such a feast profane):


<a id="org0b86d52"></a>

## Genesis 43:33

They sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his age. And they wondered very much;


<a id="orgfce6134"></a>

## Genesis 43:34

Taking the messes which they received of him: and the greater mess came to Benjamin, so that it exceeded by five parts. And they drank, and were merry with him.

# Genesis 44


<a id="org8057388"></a>

## Genesis 44:1

And Joseph commanded the steward of his house, saying: Fill their sacks with corn, as much as they can hold: and put the money of every one in the top of his sack.


<a id="orga6c4657"></a>

## Genesis 44:2

And in the mouth of the younger&rsquo;s sack put my silver cup, and the price which he gave for the wheat. And it was so done.


<a id="org0cff034"></a>

## Genesis 44:3

And when the morning arose, they were sent away with their asses.


<a id="org28514db"></a>

## Genesis 44:4

And when they were now departed out of the city, and had gone forward a little way: Joseph sending for the steward of his house, said: Arise, and pursue after the men: and when thou hast overtaken them, say to them: Why have you returned evil for good?


<a id="org8e92ac7"></a>

## Genesis 44:5

The cup which you have stolen, is that in which my lord drinketh, and in which he is wont to divine: you have done a very evil thing.


<a id="orgb8f9384"></a>

## Genesis 44:6

He did as he had commanded him. And having overtaken them, he spoke to them the same words.


<a id="orgb06993a"></a>

## Genesis 44:7

And they answered: Why doth our lord speak so, as though thy servants had committed so heinous a fact?


<a id="org8601401"></a>

## Genesis 44:8

The money, that we found in the top of our sacks, we brought back to thee from the land of Chanaan: how then should it be that we should steal out of thy lord&rsquo;s house, gold or silver?


<a id="org50bc908"></a>

## Genesis 44:9

With whomsoever of thy servants shall be found that which thou seekest, let him die, and we will be the bondmen of my lord.


<a id="org4730edf"></a>

And he said to them: Let it be according to your sentence: with whomsoever it shall be found, let him be my servant, and you shall be blameless.

Then they speedily took down their sacks to the ground, and every man opened his sack.


<a id="orga77d4c2"></a>

## Genesis 44:12

Which when he had searched, beginning at the eldest, and ending at the youngest, he found the cup in Benjamin&rsquo;s sack.

Then they rent their garments, and loading their asses again, returned into the town.


<a id="orgdb9d56d"></a>

## Genesis 44:14

And Juda at the head of his brethren went in to Joseph (for he was not yet gone out of the place) and they all together fell down before him on the ground.


<a id="org499c7e8"></a>

## Genesis 44:15

And he said to them: Why would you do so? know you not that there is no one like me in the science of divining.


<a id="orgd7bf76b"></a>

## Genesis 44:16

And Juda said to him: What shall we answer my lord? or what shall we say, or be able justly to allege? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are all bondmen to my lord, both we, and he with whom the cup was found.


<a id="orgf88647e"></a>

## Genesis 44:17

Joseph answered: God forbid that I should do so: he that stole the cup, he shall be my bondman: and go you away free to your father.


<a id="org932d9c3"></a>

## Genesis 44:18

Then Juda coming nearer, said boldly: I beseech thee, my lord, let thy servant speak a word in thy ears, and be not angry with thy servant: for after Pharao thou art.


<a id="org43d3221"></a>

## Genesis 44:19

My lord. Thou didst ask thy servants the first time: Have you a father or a brother.


<a id="org4081f15"></a>

## Genesis 44:20

And we answered thee, my lord: We have a father an old man, and a young boy, that was born in his old age; whose brother by the mother is dead; and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him tenderly.


<a id="org5151db0"></a>

## Genesis 44:21

And thou saidst to thy servants: Bring him hither to me, and I will set my eyes on him.


<a id="org3f70bfd"></a>

## Genesis 44:22

We suggested to my lord: The boy cannot leave his father: for if he leave him, he will die.


<a id="org5ede7c8"></a>

## Genesis 44:23

And thou saidst to thy servants: Except your youngest brother come with you, you shall see my face no more.


<a id="orge777e09"></a>

## Genesis 44:24

Therefore when we were gone up to thy servant our father, we told him all that my lord had said.


<a id="orge21c402"></a>

## Genesis 44:25

And our father said: Go again, and buy us a little wheat.


<a id="orgd4fffe0"></a>

## Genesis 44:26

And we said to him: We cannot go: if our youngest brother go down with us, we will set out together: otherwise, without him we dare not see the man&rsquo;s face.


<a id="orgd36db59"></a>

## Genesis 44:27

Whereunto he answered: You know that my wife bore me two.


<a id="orgf186aae"></a>

## Genesis 44:28

One went out, and you said: A beast devoured him; and hitherto he appeareth not.


<a id="org119da13"></a>

## Genesis 44:29

If you take this also, and any thing befall him in the way, you will bring down my grey hairs with sorrow unto hell.


<a id="org009b7b1"></a>

## Genesis 44:30

Therefore, if I shall go to thy servant, our father, and the boy be wanting, (whereas his life dependeth upon the life of him,)


<a id="org4e55d03"></a>

## Genesis 44:31

And he shall see that he is not with us, he will die, and thy servants shall bring down his grey hairs with sorrow unto hell.


<a id="org06f402d"></a>

## Genesis 44:32

Let me be thy proper servant, who took him into my trust, and promised, saying: If I bring him not again, I will be guilty of sin against my father for ever.


<a id="org0d94f5b"></a>

## Genesis 44:33

Therefore I, thy servant, will stay instead of the boy in the service of my lord, and let the boy go up with his brethren.


<a id="org056632f"></a>

## Genesis 44:34

For I cannot return to my father without the boy, lest I be a witness of the calamity that will oppress my father.

<a id="orgd8b6325"></a>

Be not afraid, and let it not seem to you a hard case that you sold me into these countries: for God sent me before you into Egypt for your preservation.


<a id="orgf62ac63"></a>

For it is two years since the famine began to be upon the land, and five years more remain, wherein there can be neither ploughing nor reaping.

And God sent me before, that you may be preserved upon the earth, and may have food to live.


<a id="orgb0b6220"></a>

## Genesis 45:9

And bring away from thence your father and kindred, and come to me; and I will give you all the good things of Egypt, that you may eat the marrow of the land.


<a id="orgee57478"></a>

## Genesis 45:19

Give orders also that they take wagons out of the land of Egypt, for the carriage of their children and their wives; and say: Take up your father, and make haste to come with all speed:


<a id="orgc0638fb"></a>

## Genesis 45:20

And leave nothing of your household stuff; for all the riches of Egypt shall be yours.


<a id="org0cc2e5b"></a>

<a id="org7ec4c93"></a>

He ordered also to be brought out for every one of them two robes: but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, with five robes of the best:


<a id="orgc537e0e"></a>

## Genesis 45:23

Sending to his father as much money and raiment; adding besides, ten he-asses, to carry off all the riches of Egypt, and as many she-asses, carrying wheat and bread for the journey.

And he said: It is enough for me if Joseph, my son, be yet living: I will go and see him before I die.

Five men also, the last of his brethren, he presented before the king:


<a id="orga31c41f"></a>

<a id="orgdbd0ab2"></a>

## Genesis 47:4

We are come to sojourn in thy land, because there is no grass for the flocks of thy servants, the famine being very grievous in the land of Chanaan: and we pray thee to give orders that we thy servants may be in the land of Gessen.

<a id="orgb09aaa5"></a>

<a id="orgf580c89"></a>

## Genesis 47:9

## Genesis 47:10

And blessing the king, he went out.


<a id="orgb6929ad"></a>

## Genesis 47:11

But Joseph gave a possession to his father and his brethren in Egypt, in the best place of the land, in Ramesses, as Pharao had commanded.


<a id="orgacb6240"></a>

## Genesis 47:12

And he nourished them, and all his father&rsquo;s house, allowing food to every one.


<a id="orge008eff"></a>

## Genesis 47:13

For in the whole world there was want of bread, and a famine had oppressed the land, more especially of Egypt and Chanaan;


<a id="org59e108e"></a>

## Genesis 47:14

Out of which he gathered up all the money for the corn which they bought, and brought it in to the king&rsquo;s treasure.


<a id="org593db42"></a>

## Genesis 47:15

And when the buyers wanted money, all Egypt came to Joseph, saying: Give us bread: why should we die in thy presence, having now no money?


<a id="org5abebaf"></a>

## Genesis 47:16

And he answered them: Bring me your cattle, and for them I will give you food, if you have no money.


<a id="org79671af"></a>

## Genesis 47:17

And when they had brought them, he gave them food in exchange for their horses, and sheep, and oxen, and asses: and he maintained them that year for the exchange of their cattle.


<a id="org4f322c3"></a>

## Genesis 47:18

And they came the second year, and said to him: We will not hide from our lord, how that our money is spent, and our cattle also are gone: neither art thou ignorant that we have nothing now left but our bodies and our lands.


<a id="orgf5655ee"></a>

## Genesis 47:19

Why therefore shall we die before thy eyes? we will be thine, both we and our lands: buy us to be the king&rsquo;s servants, and give us seed, lest for want of tillers the land be turned into a wilderness.


<a id="orgd401bfe"></a>

## Genesis 47:20

So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt, every man selling his possessions, because of the greatness of the famine. And he brought it into Pharao&rsquo;s hands:


<a id="org3cac560"></a>

## Genesis 47:21

And all its people from one end of the borders of Egypt, even to the other end thereof,


<a id="org36fbf0f"></a>

## Genesis 47:22

Except the land of the priests, which had been given them by the king: to whom also a certain allowance of food was given out of the public stores, and therefore they were not forced to sell their possessions.


<a id="orgf38c8b7"></a>

## Genesis 47:23

Then Joseph said to the people: Behold, as you see, both you and your lands belong to Pharao; take seed and sow the fields,


<a id="org7289277"></a>

## Genesis 47:24
