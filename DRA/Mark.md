<a id="orgc9283cd"></a>

And John was clothed camel&rsquo;s hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins: and he ate locusts and wild honey.


<a id="orgf564855"></a>

And he preached, saying: There cometh after me one mightier than I, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and loose.


<a id="org87f4ade"></a>

## Mark 1:8

I have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.


<a id="org3139833"></a>

## Mark 1:9

And it came to pass, in those days, Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in Jordan.


<a id="org7ed2c90"></a>

## Mark 1:10

And forthwith coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens open and the Spirit as a dove descending and remaining on him.


<a id="org49c8781"></a>

## Mark 1:11

And there came a voice from heaven: Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased.


<a id="orgbc8a9ed"></a>

## Mark 1:12

And immediately the Spirit drove him out into the desert.


<a id="org8890a0b"></a>

## Mark 1:13

And he was in the desert forty days and forty nights, and was tempted by Satan. And he was with beasts: and the angels ministered to him.


<a id="org6dd9689"></a>

And after that John was delivered up, Jesus came in Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,


<a id="org287cd0e"></a>

And saying: The time is accomplished and the kingdom of God is at hand. Repent and believe the gospel:


<a id="orgbb0ed0f"></a>

## Mark 1:16

And passing by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother, casting nets into the sea for they were fishermen.


<a id="orgfa8905c"></a>

## Mark 1:17

And Jesus said to them: Come after me; and I will make you to become fishers of men.


<a id="org6c6c70b"></a>

## Mark 1:18

And immediately leaving their nets, they followed him.


<a id="org44d75ba"></a>

## Mark 1:19

And going on from thence a little farther, he saw James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, who also were mending their nets in the ship:


<a id="orgf125917"></a>

## Mark 1:20

And forthwith he called them. And leaving their father Zebedee in the ship with his hired men, they followed him.


<a id="org9d1df2f"></a>

## Mark 1:21

And they entered into Capharnaum: and forthwith upon the sabbath days going into the synagogue, he taught them.


<a id="org5515372"></a>

## Mark 1:22

And they were astonished at his doctrine. For he was teaching them as one having power, and not as the scribes.


<a id="org71482af"></a>

## Mark 1:23

And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,


<a id="org3c8bff6"></a>

## Mark 1:24

Saying: What have we to do with thee, Jesus of Nazareth? Art thou come to destroy us? I know who thou art, the Holy One of God.


<a id="org68d8437"></a>

## Mark 1:25

And Jesus threatened him, saying: Speak no more, and go out of the man.


<a id="orge4080a1"></a>

## Mark 1:26

And the unclean spirit, tearing him and crying out with a loud voice, went out of him.


<a id="org921cc24"></a>

## Mark 1:27

And they were all amazed insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying: What thing is this? What is this new doctrine? For with power he commandeth even the unclean spirits: and they obey him.


<a id="orgac982d8"></a>

## Mark 1:28

And the fame of him was spread forthwith into all the country of Galilee.


<a id="org54263bb"></a>

## Mark 1:29

And immediately going out of the synagogue they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.


<a id="orgb64ebb9"></a>

## Mark 1:30

And Simon&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s mother lay in a fit of a fever: and forthwith they tell him of her.


<a id="org0c01735"></a>

## Mark 1:31

And coming to her, he lifted her up, taking her by the hand; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.


<a id="orgdd5b3dd"></a>

## Mark 1:32

And when it was evening, after sunset, they brought to him all that were ill and that were possessed with devils.


<a id="org116cd92"></a>

## Mark 1:33

And all the city was gathered together at the door.


<a id="org6235de6"></a>

## Mark 1:34

And he healed many that were troubled with divers diseases. And he cast out many devils: and he suffered them not to speak, because they knew him.


<a id="orga52b5f6"></a>

## Mark 1:35

And rising very early, going out, he went into a desert place: and there he prayed.


<a id="org190e494"></a>

## Mark 1:36

And Simon and they that were with him followed after him.


<a id="org4951111"></a>

## Mark 1:37

And when they had found him, they said to him: All seek for thee.


<a id="org15e06af"></a>

## Mark 1:38

And he saith to them: Let us go into the neighbouring towns and cities, that I may preach there also; for to this purpose am I come.


<a id="org71d8ef3"></a>

## Mark 1:39

And he was preaching in their synagogues and in all Galilee and casting out devils.


<a id="org7a9feb8"></a>

## Mark 1:40

And there came a leper to him, beseeching him and kneeling down, said to him: If thou wilt thou canst make me clean.


<a id="org180cb6f"></a>

## Mark 1:41

And Jesus, having compassion on him, stretched forth his hand and touching him saith to him: I will. Be thou made clean.


<a id="orga9d0910"></a>

## Mark 1:42

And when he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him: and he was made clean.


<a id="org95301f6"></a>

## Mark 1:43

And he strictly charged him and forthwith sent him away.


<a id="org9dfcb2f"></a>

## Mark 1:44

And he saith to him: See thou tell no one; but go, shew thyself to the high priest and offer for thy cleansing the things that Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.


<a id="org29b814b"></a>

## Mark 1:45

But he being gone out, began to publish and to blaze abroad the word: so that he could not openly go into the city. but was without in desert places. And they flocked to him from all sides. 


<a id="org20d0f03"></a>

# Mark 2


<a id="org2a6a723"></a>

## Mark 2:1

And again he entered into Capharnaum after some days.


<a id="orgc8fe753"></a>

## Mark 2:2

And it was heard that he was in the house. And many came together, so that there was no room: no, not even at the door. And he spoke to them the word.


<a id="orgb87b57e"></a>

## Mark 2:3

And they came to him, bringing one sick of the palsy, who was carried by four.


<a id="orgf8b46b7"></a>

## Mark 2:4

And when they could not offer him unto him for the multitude, they uncovered the roof where he was: and opening it, they let down the bed wherein the man sick of the palsy lay.


<a id="org3704468"></a>

## Mark 2:5

And when Jesus had seen their faith, he saith to the sick of the palsy: Son, thy sins are forgiven thee.


<a id="org9ae15a3"></a>

## Mark 2:6

And there were some of the scribes sitting there and thinking in their hearts:


<a id="org1abfc1a"></a>

## Mark 2:7

Why doth this man speak thus? He blasphemeth. Who can forgive sins, but God only?


<a id="org2e2e4b4"></a>

## Mark 2:8

Which Jesus presently knowing in his spirit that they so thought within themselves, saith to them: Why think you these things in your hearts?


<a id="orgc9ad8f3"></a>

## Mark 2:9

Which is easier, to say to the sick of the palsy: Thy sins are forgiven thee; or to say: Arise, take up thy bed and walk?


<a id="orgc1ed767"></a>

## Mark 2:10

But that you may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins (he saith to the sick of the palsy):


<a id="org2137822"></a>

## Mark 2:11

I say to thee: Arise. Take up thy bed and go into thy house.


<a id="orgdccfb41"></a>

## Mark 2:12

And immediately he arose and, taking up his bed, went his way in the sight of all: so that all wondered and glorified God, saying: We never saw the like.


<a id="org6d53ebb"></a>

## Mark 2:13

And he went forth again to the sea side: and all the multitude came to him. And he taught them.


<a id="org5974ae3"></a>

## Mark 2:14

And when he was passing by, he saw Levi, the son of Alpheus, sitting at the receipt of custom; and he saith to him: Follow me. And rising up, he followed him.


<a id="orgde4809b"></a>

## Mark 2:15

And it came to pass as he sat at meat in his house, many Publicans and sinners sat down together with Jesus and his disciples. For they were many, who also followed him.


<a id="org0e6640c"></a>

## Mark 2:16

And the scribes and the Pharisees, seeing that he ate with publicans and sinners, said to his disciples: Why doth your master eat and drink with publicans and sinners?


<a id="orga363787"></a>

## Mark 2:17

Jesus hearing this, saith to them: They that are well have no need of a physician, but they that are sick. For I came not to call the just, but sinners.


<a id="orgf52034f"></a>

## Mark 2:18

And the disciples of John and the Pharisees used to fast. And they come and say to him: Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast; but thy disciples do not fast?


<a id="org98baf34"></a>

## Mark 2:19

And Jesus saith to them: Can the children of the marriage fast, as long as the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.


<a id="orgba77273"></a>

## Mark 2:20

But the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them: and then they shall fast in those days.


<a id="org4706d11"></a>

## Mark 2:21

<a id="org1b8002c"></a>

## Mark 2:22

And no man putteth new wine into old bottles: otherwise the wine will burst the bottles, and both the wine will be spilled and the bottles will be lost. But new wine must be put into new bottles.


<a id="orgf715370"></a>

## Mark 2:23

And it came to pass again, as the Lord walked through the corn fields on the sabbath, that his disciples began to go forward and to pluck the ears of corn.


<a id="org5f35eda"></a>

## Mark 2:24

And the Pharisees said to him: Behold, why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful?


<a id="orgf56a2f6"></a>

## Mark 2:25

And he said to them: Have you never read what David did when he had need and was hungry, himself and they that were with him?


<a id="org36489f9"></a>

## Mark 2:26

How he went into the house of God, under Abiathar the high priest, and did eat the loaves of proposition, which was not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave to them who were with him?


<a id="orgd2b597d"></a>

## Mark 2:27

And he said to them: The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath.


<a id="orge3e92a8"></a>

Therefore the Son of man is Lord of the sabbath also. 


<a id="orgcef0acb"></a>

# Mark 3


<a id="orge1d0d12"></a>

## Mark 3:1

And he entered again into the synagogue: and there was a man there who had a withered hand.


<a id="org42b1d74"></a>

## Mark 3:2

And they watched him whether he would heal on the sabbath days, that they might accuse him.


<a id="orgad7e53f"></a>

## Mark 3:3

And he said to the man who had the withered hand: Stand up in the midst.


<a id="org8f208e7"></a>

## Mark 3:4

And he saith to them: Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days, or to do evil? To save life, or to destroy? But they held their peace.


<a id="orge375bf8"></a>

## Mark 3:5

And looking round about on them with anger, being grieved for the blindness of their hearts, he saith to the man: Stretch forth thy hand. And he stretched it forth: and his hand was restored unto him.


<a id="org96ca5e4"></a>

## Mark 3:6

And the Pharisees going out, immediately made a consultation with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.


<a id="orgc1f97db"></a>

## Mark 3:7

But Jesus retired with his disciples to the sea; and a great multitude followed him from Galilee and Judea,


<a id="org5c6c949"></a>

## Mark 3:8

And from Jerusalem, and from Idumea and from beyond the Jordan. And they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, hearing the things which he did, came to him.


<a id="org62d950d"></a>

## Mark 3:9

And he spoke to his disciples that a small ship should wait on him, because of the multitude, lest they should throng him.


<a id="org3463240"></a>

## Mark 3:10

For he healed many, so that they pressed upon him for to touch him, as many as had evils.


<a id="org47ebd59"></a>

And the unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him: and they cried, saying:


<a id="orgb7653f0"></a>

## Mark 3:12

<a id="orged454bb"></a>

## Mark 3:13

And going up into a mountain, he called unto him whom he would himself: and they came to him.


<a id="orge2225da"></a>

## Mark 3:14

And he made that twelve should be with him, and that he might send them to preach.


<a id="org107dd0c"></a>

## Mark 3:15

And he gave them power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out devils.


<a id="orga8c3b1d"></a>

## Mark 3:16

And to Simon he gave the name Peter:


<a id="orgce8f654"></a>

## Mark 3:17

And James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and he named them Boanerges, which is, The sons of thunder.


<a id="orga457b14"></a>

## Mark 3:18

And Andrew and Philip, and Bartholomew and Matthew, and Thomas and James of Alpheus, and Thaddeus and Simon the Cananean:

## Mark 3:19

And Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.


<a id="org496ff68"></a>

## Mark 3:20

And they come to a house, and the multitude cometh together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread.


<a id="orgfea178e"></a>

## Mark 3:21

And when his friends had heard of it, they went out to lay hold on him. For they said: He is become mad.


<a id="orgd3c7093"></a>

## Mark 3:22

And the scribes who were come down from Jerusalem, said: He hath Beelzebub, and by the prince of devils he casteth out devils.


<a id="orgffadca0"></a>

## Mark 3:23

And after he had called them together, he said to them in parables: How can Satan cast out Satan?


<a id="org5d95d18"></a>

## Mark 3:24

And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.


<a id="org70ab2be"></a>

## Mark 3:25

And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand.


<a id="orga5354e1"></a>

## Mark 3:26

And if Satan be risen up against himself, he is divided, and cannot stand, but hath an end.


<a id="orgc1d9001"></a>

## Mark 3:27

No man can enter into the house of a strong man and rob him of his goods, unless he first bind the strong man, and then shall he plunder his house.


<a id="org65f2c85"></a>

## Mark 3:28

Amen I say to you that all sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and the blasphemies wherewith they shall blaspheme:


<a id="org31a1ba9"></a>

## Mark 3:29

But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost, shall never have forgiveness, but shall be guilty of an everlasting sin.


<a id="org2b5ab8c"></a>

## Mark 3:30

Because they said: He hath an unclean spirit.


<a id="org8122b53"></a>

## Mark 3:31

And his mother and his brethren came; and standing without, sent unto him, calling him.


<a id="org727baa3"></a>

## Mark 3:32

And the multitude sat about him; and they say to him: Behold thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee.


<a id="orgea22861"></a>

## Mark 3:33

And answering them, he said: Who is my mother and my brethren?


<a id="orgd912233"></a>

## Mark 3:34

And looking round about on them who sat about him, he saith: Behold my mother and my brethren.


<a id="orgcba2c25"></a>

## Mark 3:35

For whosoever shall do the will of God, he is my brother, and my sister, and mother. 


<a id="orgefe0102"></a>

# Mark 4


<a id="org6fbeac6"></a>

## Mark 4:1

And again he began to teach by the sea side; and a great multitude was gathered together unto him, so that he went up into a ship and sat in the sea: and all the multitude was upon the land by the sea side.


<a id="org6cefbfa"></a>

## Mark 4:2

And he taught them many things in parables, and said unto them in his doctrine:


<a id="org3785271"></a>

## Mark 4:3

Hear ye: Behold, the sower went out to sow.


<a id="orgdb4bd00"></a>

## Mark 4:4

And whilst he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the birds of the air came and ate it up.


<a id="org5d363e7"></a>

## Mark 4:5

And other some fell upon stony ground, where it had not much earth; and it shot up immediately, because it had no depth of earth.


<a id="org9e99e55"></a>

## Mark 4:6

And when the sun was risen, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.


<a id="orga15b3b2"></a>

## Mark 4:7

And some fell among thorns; and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.


<a id="org7b68ca7"></a>

## Mark 4:8

And some fell upon good ground; and brought forth fruit that grew up, and increased and yielded, one thirty, another sixty, and another a hundred.


<a id="org58f9a90"></a>

## Mark 4:9

And he said: He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.


<a id="org754456d"></a>

## Mark 4:10

And when he was alone, the twelve that were with him asked him the parable.


<a id="org7092fe9"></a>

## Mark 4:11

And he said to them: To you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but to them that are without, all things are done in parables:


<a id="org808f249"></a>

## Mark 4:12

That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and their sins should be forgiven them.


<a id="org35e1dea"></a>

## Mark 4:13

And he saith to them: Are you ignorant of this, parable? and how shall you know all parables?


<a id="org82edfaa"></a>

## Mark 4:14

He that soweth, soweth the word.


<a id="org2a84587"></a>

## Mark 4:15

And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown, and as soon as they have heard, immediately Satan cometh and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts.


<a id="org5001da2"></a>

## Mark 4:16

And these likewise are they that are sown on the stony ground: who when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with joy.


<a id="orga0dfa86"></a>

## Mark 4:17

And they have no root in themselves, but are only for a time: and then when tribulation and persecution ariseth for the word they are presently scandalized.


<a id="orgf50e193"></a>

## Mark 4:18

And others there are who are sown among thorns: these are they that hear the word,


<a id="orgd244d2d"></a>

## Mark 4:19

And the cares of the world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts after other things entering in choke the word, and it is made fruitless.


<a id="orgb47f874"></a>

## Mark 4:20

And these are they who are sown upon the good ground, who hear the word, and receive it, and yield fruit, the one thirty, another sixty, and another a hundred.


<a id="orge6e4832"></a>

## Mark 4:21

And he said to them: Doth a candle come in to be put under a bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick?


<a id="org041bff7"></a>

## Mark 4:22

For there is nothing hid, which shall not be made manifest: neither was it made secret, but that it may come abroad.


<a id="org57368ad"></a>

## Mark 4:23

If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.


<a id="org3696e03"></a>

## Mark 4:24

And he said to them: Take heed what you hear. In what measure you shall mete, it shall be measured to you again, and more shall be given to you.


<a id="orgcdf6d18"></a>

## Mark 4:25

For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, that also which he hath shall be taken away from him.


<a id="org24a1c25"></a>

## Mark 4:26

And he said: So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the earth,


<a id="orgbe66b68"></a>

## Mark 4:27

And should sleep, and rise, night and day, and the seed should spring, and grow up whilst he knoweth not.


<a id="orgd252059"></a>

## Mark 4:28

For the earth of itself bringeth forth fruit, first the blade, then the ear, afterwards the full corn in the ear.


<a id="org568e9eb"></a>

## Mark 4:29

And when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come.


<a id="orgf7c7c83"></a>

## Mark 4:30

And he said: To what shall we liken the kingdom of God? or to what parable shall we compare it?


<a id="orga8740c4"></a>

## Mark 4:31

It is as a grain of mustard seed: which when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that are in the earth:


<a id="orgda1c9ba"></a>

## Mark 4:32

And when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches, so that the birds of the air may dwell under the shadow thereof.


<a id="org28fb98a"></a>

## Mark 4:33

And with many such parables, he spoke to them the word, according as they were able to hear.


<a id="orgf6a4390"></a>

## Mark 4:34

And without parable he did not speak unto them; but apart, he explained all things to his disciples.


<a id="orgeb4a3b4"></a>

## Mark 4:35

And he saith to them that day, when evening was come: Let us pass over to the other side.


<a id="org4e213f9"></a>

## Mark 4:36

And sending away the multitude, they take him even as he was in the ship: and there were other ships with him.


<a id="org00c5a2d"></a>

## Mark 4:37

And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that the ship was filled.


<a id="org07d8066"></a>

## Mark 4:38

And he was in the hinder part of the ship, sleeping upon a pillow; and they awake him, and say to him: Master, doth, it not concern thee that we perish?


<a id="orge56a4a1"></a>

## Mark 4:39

And rising up, he rebuked the wind, and said to the sea: Peace, be still. And the wind ceased: and there was made a great calm.


<a id="orgeea135b"></a>

## Mark 4:40

And he said to them: Why are you fearful? have you not faith yet? And they feared exceedingly: and they said one to another: Who is this (thinkest thou) that both wind and sea obey him? 


<a id="org2880b50"></a>

# Mark 5


<a id="org25df8ee"></a>

## Mark 5:1

And they came over the strait of the sea, into the country of the Gerasens.


<a id="orgf62d8b7"></a>

## Mark 5:2

And as he went out of the ship, immediately there met him out of the monuments a man with an unclean spirit,


<a id="orgda9d3ec"></a>

## Mark 5:3

Who had his dwelling in the tombs, and no man now could bind him, not even with chains.


<a id="org4d80c64"></a>

## Mark 5:4

For having been often bound with fetters and chains, he had burst the chains, and broken the fetters in pieces, and no one could tame him.


<a id="org21d4f68"></a>

## Mark 5:5

And he was always day and night in the monuments and in the mountains, crying and cutting himself with stones.


<a id="org630bff8"></a>

## Mark 5:6

And seeing Jesus afar off, he ran and adored him.


<a id="orged93425"></a>

## Mark 5:7

And crying with a loud voice, he said: What have I to do with thee, Jesus the Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by God that thou torment me not.


<a id="orgdedd685"></a>

## Mark 5:8

For he said unto him: Go out of the man, thou unclean spirit.


<a id="org8aa5733"></a>

## Mark 5:9

And he asked him: What is thy name? And he saith to him: My name is Legion, for we are many.


<a id="org462ed13"></a>

## Mark 5:10

And he besought him much, that he would not drive him away out of the country.


<a id="org9b2cc4a"></a>

## Mark 5:11

And there was there near the mountain a great herd of swine, feeding.


<a id="org1f76f3c"></a>

## Mark 5:12

And the spirits besought him, saying: Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them.


<a id="org088594a"></a>

## Mark 5:13

And Jesus immediately gave them leave. And the unclean spirits going out, entered into the swine: and the herd with great violence was carried headlong into the sea, being about two thousand, were stifled in the sea.


<a id="org7302ab8"></a>

## Mark 5:14

And they that fed them fled, and told it in the city and in the fields. And they went out to see what was done:


<a id="org05970d6"></a>

## Mark 5:15

And they came to Jesus, and they see him that was troubled with the devil, sitting, clothed, and well in his wits, and they were afraid.


<a id="orga3e3648"></a>

## Mark 5:16

And they that had seen it, told them, in what manner he had been dealt with who had the devil; and concerning the swine.


<a id="orgd8a124d"></a>

## Mark 5:17

And they began to pray him that he would depart from their coasts.


<a id="orgf7d204c"></a>

## Mark 5:18

And when he went up into the ship, he that had been troubled with the devil, began to beseech him that he might be with him.


<a id="org0ee7429"></a>

## Mark 5:19

And he admitted him not, but saith him: Go into thy house to thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and hath had mercy thee.


<a id="org9075714"></a>

## Mark 5:20

And he went his way, and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him: and all men wondered.


<a id="org7a0a872"></a>

## Mark 5:21

And when Jesus had passed again in the ship over the strait, a great multitude assembled together unto him, and he was nigh unto the sea.


<a id="org760c625"></a>

## Mark 5:22

And there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue named Jairus: and seeing him, falleth down at his feet.


<a id="org57a5de4"></a>

## Mark 5:23

And he besought him much, saying: My daughter is at the point of death, come, lay thy hand upon her, that she may be safe, and may live.


<a id="org57d838a"></a>

## Mark 5:24

And he went with him, and a great multitude followed him, and they thronged him.


<a id="org27480f9"></a>

## Mark 5:25

And a woman who was under an issue of blood twelve years,


<a id="org23845a2"></a>

## Mark 5:26

And had suffered many things from many physicians; and had spent all that she had, and was nothing the better, but rather worse,


<a id="org4aa0081"></a>

## Mark 5:27

When she had heard of Jesus, came in the crowd behind him, and touched his garment.


<a id="org74e9bc8"></a>

## Mark 5:28

For she said: If I shall touch but his garment, I shall be whole.


<a id="org725f269"></a>

## Mark 5:29

And forthwith the fountain of her blood was dried up, and she felt in her body that she was healed of the evil.


<a id="org7f0a3c8"></a>

## Mark 5:30

And immediately Jesus knowing in himself the virtue that had proceeded from him, turning to the multitude, said: Who hath touched my garments?


<a id="org7f86f7c"></a>

## Mark 5:31

And his disciples said to him: Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou who hath touched me?


<a id="orgf3aeb35"></a>

## Mark 5:32

And he looked about to see her who had done this.


<a id="org99303db"></a>

## Mark 5:33

But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.


<a id="org93d452e"></a>

## Mark 5:34

And he said to her: Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole: go in peace, and be thou whole of thy disease.


<a id="org45df4a8"></a>

## Mark 5:35

While he was yet speaking, some come from the ruler of the synagogue&rsquo;s house, saying: Thy daughter is dead: why dost thou trouble the master any further?


<a id="orga546507"></a>

## Mark 5:36

But Jesus having heard the word that was spoken, saith to the ruler of the synagogue: Fear not, only believe.


<a id="org13f5444"></a>

## Mark 5:37

And he admitted not any man to follow him, but Peter, and James, and John the brother of James.


<a id="org81ceb23"></a>

## Mark 5:38

And they cone to the house of the ruler of the synagogue; and he seeth a tumult, and people weeping and wailing much.


<a id="org799c446"></a>

## Mark 5:39

And going in, he saith to them Why make you this ado, and weep? the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth.


<a id="org5493f05"></a>

## Mark 5:40

And they laughed him to scorn. But he having put them all out, taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and them that were with him, and entereth in where the damsel was lying.


<a id="orgb54552b"></a>

## Mark 5:41

And taking the damsel by the hand, he saith to her: Talitha cumi, which is, being interpreted: Damsel (I say to thee) arise.


<a id="org6908327"></a>

## Mark 5:42

And immediately the damsel rose up, and walked: and she was twelve years old: and they were astonished with a great astonishment.


<a id="org8e6db5e"></a>

## Mark 5:43

And he charged them strictly that no man should know it: and commanded that something should be given her to eat. 


<a id="orgad913a2"></a>

# Mark 6


<a id="org86d991b"></a>

## Mark 6:1

And going out from thence, he went into his own country; and his disciples followed him.


<a id="org2de6556"></a>

## Mark 6:2

And when the Sabbath was come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing him were in admiration at his doctrine, saying: How came this man by all these things? and what wisdom is this that is given to him, and such mighty works as are wrought by his hands?


<a id="org1fb15bf"></a>

## Mark 6:3

Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joseph, and Jude, and Simon? are not also his sisters here with us? And they were scandalized in regard of him.


<a id="org3314c2c"></a>

## Mark 6:4

And Jesus said to them: A prophet is not without honour, but in his own country, and in his own house, and among his own kindred.


<a id="org2277290"></a>

## Mark 6:5

And he could not do any miracles there, only that he cured a few that were sick, laying his hands upon them.


<a id="org0890634"></a>

## Mark 6:6

And he wondered because of their unbelief, and he went through the villages round about teaching.


<a id="org4899dd6"></a>

## Mark 6:7

And he called the twelve; and began to send them two and two, and gave them power over unclean spirits.


<a id="org737d097"></a>

## Mark 6:8

And he commanded them that they should take nothing for the way, but a staff only; no scrip, no bread, nor money in their purse,


<a id="org372163e"></a>

## Mark 6:9

But to be shod with sandals, and that they should not put on two coats.


<a id="orgd94e8e7"></a>

## Mark 6:10

And he said to them: Wheresoever you shall enter into an house, there abide till you depart from that place.


<a id="org1872157"></a>

## Mark 6:11

And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you; going forth from thence, shake off the dust from your feet for a testimony to them.


<a id="orgd510aec"></a>

## Mark 6:12

And going forth they preached men should do penance:


<a id="org53f4e1e"></a>

## Mark 6:13

And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them.


<a id="org078ca22"></a>

## Mark 6:14

And king Herod heard, (for his name was made manifest,) and he said: John the Baptist is risen again from dead, and therefore mighty works shew forth themselves in him.


<a id="orgd51b754"></a>

## Mark 6:15

And others said: It is Elias. But others said: It is a prophet, as one of the prophets.


<a id="orgfa77283"></a>

## Mark 6:16

Which Herod hearing, said: John whom I beheaded, he is risen again from the dead.


<a id="org9fb5879"></a>

## Mark 6:17

For Herod himself had sent and apprehended John, and bound him prison for the sake of Herodias the wife of Philip his brother, because he had married her.


<a id="org1c2ea4c"></a>

## Mark 6:18

For John said to Herod: It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother&rsquo;s wife.


<a id="org5cf8100"></a>

## Mark 6:19

Now Herodias laid snares for him: and was desirous to put him to death and could not.


<a id="org79217c7"></a>

## Mark 6:20

For Herod feared John, knowing him to be a just and holy man: and kept him, and when he heard him, did many things: and he heard him willingly.


<a id="org25d0b12"></a>

## Mark 6:21

And when a convenient day was come, Herod made a supper for his birthday, for the princes, and tribunes, and chief men of Galilee.


<a id="orgcdb16d8"></a>

## Mark 6:22

And when the daughter of the same Herodias had come in, and had danced, and pleased Herod, and them that were at table with him, the king said to the damsel: Ask of me what thou wilt, and I will give it thee.


<a id="orgcd413fb"></a>

## Mark 6:23

And he swore to her: Whatsoever thou shalt ask I will give thee, though it be the half of my kingdom.


<a id="orgabf3c2e"></a>

## Mark 6:24

Who when she was gone out, said to her mother, What shall I ask? But her mother said: The head of John the Baptist.


<a id="org32e3679"></a>

## Mark 6:25

And when she was come in immediately with haste to the king, she asked, saying: I will that forthwith thou give me in a dish, the head of John the Baptist.


<a id="orgf7f5696"></a>

## Mark 6:26

And the king was struck sad. Yet because of his oath, and because of them that were with him at table, he would not displease her:


<a id="org1dfa626"></a>

## Mark 6:27

But sending an executioner, he commanded that his head should be brought in a dish.


<a id="orgb482356"></a>

## Mark 6:28

And he beheaded him in the prison, and brought his head in a dish: and gave to the damsel, and the damsel gave it her mother.


<a id="org91de8cf"></a>

## Mark 6:29

Which his disciples hearing came, and took his body, and laid it in a tomb.


<a id="org4074f03"></a>

## Mark 6:30

And the apostles coming together unto Jesus, related to him all things that they had done and taught.


<a id="org4b1bc5d"></a>

## Mark 6:31

And he said to them: Come apart into a desert place, and rest a little. For there were many coming and going: and they had not so much as time to eat.


<a id="orgbfe1439"></a>

## Mark 6:32

And going up into a ship, they went into a desert place apart.


<a id="org69a854b"></a>

## Mark 6:33

And they saw them going away, and many knew: and they ran flocking thither foot from all the cities, and were there before them.


<a id="orgc37a10e"></a>

## Mark 6:34

And Jesus going out saw a great multitude: and he had compassion on them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd, and he began to teach them many things.


<a id="org4d56de5"></a>

## Mark 6:35

And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came to him, saying: This is a desert place, and the hour is now past:


<a id="org75b9f4f"></a>

## Mark 6:36

Send them away, that going into the next villages and towns, they may buy themselves meat to eat.


<a id="org06a78b5"></a>

## Mark 6:37

And he answering said to them: Give you them to eat. And they said to him: Let us go and buy bread for two hundred pence, and we will give them to eat.


<a id="orgd72ad17"></a>

## Mark 6:38

And he saith to them: How many loaves have you? go and see. And when they knew, they say: Five, and two fishes.


<a id="org6a1076e"></a>

## Mark 6:39

And he commanded them that they should make them all sit down by companies upon the green grass.


<a id="orgd30b66e"></a>

## Mark 6:40

And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds and by fifties.


<a id="orgc109cf2"></a>

## Mark 6:41

And when he had taken the five loaves, and the two fishes: looking up to heaven, he blessed, and broke the loaves, and gave to his disciples to set before them: and the two fishes he divided among them all.


<a id="orge78f9da"></a>

## Mark 6:42

And they all did eat, and had their fill.


<a id="org1dcde12"></a>

## Mark 6:43

And they took up the leavings, twelve full baskets of fragments, and of the fishes.


<a id="org46e7edb"></a>

## Mark 6:44

And they that did eat, were five thousand men.


<a id="org111c6b3"></a>

## Mark 6:45

And immediately he obliged his disciples to go up into the ship, that they might go before him over the water to Bethsaida, whilst he dismissed the people.


<a id="orgf06b8d2"></a>

## Mark 6:46

And when he had dismissed them, he went up to the mountain to pray,


<a id="org71591f9"></a>

## Mark 6:47

And when it was late, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and himself alone on the land.


<a id="org20ce6e7"></a>

## Mark 6:48

And seeing them labouring in rowing, (for the wind was against them,) and about the fourth watch of the night, he cometh to them walking upon the sea, and he would have passed by them.


<a id="orgc8d7b84"></a>

## Mark 6:49

But they seeing him walking upon the sea, thought it was an apparition, and they cried out.


<a id="orgcb00f69"></a>

## Mark 6:50

For they all saw him, and were troubled bled. And immediately he spoke with them, and said to them: Have a good heart, it is I, fear ye not.


<a id="org9ccf1ae"></a>

## Mark 6:51

And he went up to them into the ship, and the wind ceased: and they were far more astonished within themselves:


<a id="orgfe60b48"></a>

## Mark 6:52

For they understood not concerning the loaves; for their heart was blinded.


<a id="org4fa3a14"></a>

## Mark 6:53

And when they had passed over, they came into the land of Genezareth, and set to the shore.


<a id="orgfd33034"></a>

## Mark 6:54

And when they were gone out of the ship, immediately they knew him:


<a id="org523cbc0"></a>

## Mark 6:55

And running through that whole country, they began to carry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he was.


<a id="org28e0f02"></a>

## Mark 6:56

And whithersoever he entered, into towns or into villages or cities, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might touch but the hem of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole. 


<a id="org44bf0db"></a>

# Mark 7


<a id="orga84cfc3"></a>

## Mark 7:1

And there assembled together unto him the Pharisees and some of the scribes, coming from Jerusalem.


<a id="org01e9145"></a>

## Mark 7:2

And when they had seen some of his disciples eat bread with common, that is, with unwashed hands, they found fault.


<a id="org03eec55"></a>

## Mark 7:3

For the Pharisees and all the Jews eat not without often washing their hands, holding the tradition of the ancients.


<a id="org65a5e3a"></a>

## Mark 7:4

And when they come from the market, unless they be washed, they eat not: and many other things there are that have been delivered to them to observe, the washings of cups and of pots and of brazen vessels and of beds.


<a id="orga20d866"></a>

## Mark 7:5

And the Pharisees and scribes asked him: Why do not thy disciples walk according to the tradition of the ancients, but they eat bread with common hands?


<a id="org84deaab"></a>

## Mark 7:6

But he answering, said to them: Well did Isaias prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written: This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.


<a id="org1ab58f3"></a>

## Mark 7:7

And in vain do they worship me, teaching doctrines and precepts of men.


<a id="org20ac7a6"></a>

## Mark 7:8

For leaving the commandment of God, you hold the tradition of men, the washing of pots and of cups: and many other things you do like to these.


<a id="org4327a52"></a>

## Mark 7:9

And he said to them: Well do you make void the commandment of God, that you may keep your own tradition.


<a id="org896d82e"></a>

## Mark 7:10

For Moses said: Honour thy father and thy mother. And He that shall curse father or mother, dying let him die.


<a id="org70f3a54"></a>

## Mark 7:11

But you say: If a man shall say to his father or mother, Corban (which is a gift) whatsoever is from me shall profit thee.


<a id="orgb71435b"></a>

## Mark 7:12

And further you suffer him not to do any thing for his father or mother,


<a id="orgd2d0e86"></a>

## Mark 7:13

Making void the word of God by your own tradition, which you have given forth. And many other such like things you do.


<a id="org59ce167"></a>

## Mark 7:14

And calling again the multitude unto him, he said to them: Hear ye me all and understand.


<a id="org964b07a"></a>

## Mark 7:15

There is nothing from without a man that entering into him can defile him. But the things which come from a man, those are they that defile a man.


<a id="org6675240"></a>

## Mark 7:16

If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.


<a id="org1bbc67e"></a>

## Mark 7:17

And when he was come into the house from the multitude, his disciples asked him the parable.


<a id="org83ce929"></a>

## Mark 7:18

And he saith to them: So are you also without knowledge? Understand you not that every thing from without entering into a man cannot defile him:


<a id="org12e17ed"></a>

## Mark 7:19

Because it entereth not into his heart but goeth into his belly and goeth out into the privy, purging all meats?


<a id="orga3c9b48"></a>

## Mark 7:20

But he said that the things which come out from a man, they defile a man.


<a id="org3cc4290"></a>

## Mark 7:21

For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,


<a id="org33d4f87"></a>

## Mark 7:22

Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness.


<a id="org634bd96"></a>

## Mark 7:23

All these evil things come from within and defile a man.


<a id="org94767da"></a>

## Mark 7:24

And rising from thence he went into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon: and entering into a house, he would that no man should know it. And he could not be hid.


<a id="org1854b1a"></a>

## Mark 7:25

For a woman as soon as she heard of him, whose daughter had an unclean spirit, came in and fell down at his feet.


<a id="org32f30a9"></a>

## Mark 7:26

For the woman was a Gentile, a Syrophenician born. And she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter.


<a id="orgf104785"></a>

## Mark 7:27

Who said to her: suffer first the children to be filled: for it is not good to take the bread of the children and cast it to the dogs.


<a id="org42f498e"></a>

## Mark 7:28

But she answered and said to him: Yea, Lord; for the whelps also eat under the table of the crumbs of the children.


<a id="org26e7e1a"></a>

## Mark 7:29

And he said to her: For this saying, go thy way. The devil is gone out of thy daughter.


<a id="org8a5d091"></a>

## Mark 7:30

And when she was come into her house, she found the girl lying upon the bed and that the devil was gone out.


<a id="org3b298e2"></a>

## Mark 7:31

And again going out of the coasts of Tyre, he came by Sidon to the sea of Galilee, through the midst the of the coasts of Decapolis.


<a id="org965091e"></a>

## Mark 7:32

And they bring to him one deaf and dumb: and they besought him that he would lay his hand upon him.


<a id="org44ba4cc"></a>

## Mark 7:33

And taking him from the multitude apart, he put his fingers into his ears: and spitting, he touched his tongue.


<a id="org67bf85e"></a>

## Mark 7:34

And looking up to heaven, he groaned and said to him: Ephpheta, which is, Be thou opened.


<a id="orgf7d2d09"></a>

## Mark 7:35

And immediately his ears were opened and the string of his tongue was loosed and he spoke right.


<a id="org84ba20c"></a>

## Mark 7:36

And he charged them that they should tell no man. But the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal did they publish it.


<a id="org59bb3a2"></a>

## Mark 7:37

And so much the more did they wonder, saying: He hath done all things well. He hath made both the deaf to hear and the dumb to speak. 


<a id="org1672a23"></a>

# Mark 8


<a id="org03b93f7"></a>

## Mark 8:1

In those days again, when there was great multitude and they had nothing to eat; calling his disciples together, he saith to them:


<a id="org376439e"></a>

## Mark 8:2

I have compassion on the multitude, for behold they have now been with me three days and have nothing to eat.


<a id="org6c4313e"></a>

## Mark 8:3

And if I shall send them away fasting to their home, they will faint in the way: for some of them came from afar off.


<a id="org61dc793"></a>

## Mark 8:4

And his disciples answered him: From whence can any one fill them here with bread in the wilderness?


<a id="org458ed97"></a>

## Mark 8:5

And he asked them: How many loaves have ye? Who said: Seven.


<a id="org5416b82"></a>

## Mark 8:6

And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground. And taking the seven loaves, giving thanks, he broke and gave to his disciples for to set before them. And they set them before the people.


<a id="org861d2d1"></a>

## Mark 8:7

And they had a few little fishes: and he blessed them and commanded them to be set before them.


<a id="org8491002"></a>

## Mark 8:8

And they did eat and were filled: and they took up that which was left of the fragments, seven baskets.


<a id="org399c96f"></a>

## Mark 8:9

And they that had eaten were about four thousand. And he sent them away.

And when evening was come, he went forth out of the city.


<a id="org3a48a03"></a>

## Mark 11:20

And when they passed by in the morning they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots.


<a id="org1864ce7"></a>

## Mark 11:21

And Peter remembering, said to him: Rabbi, behold the fig tree which thou didst curse is withered away.


<a id="org53d1fbf"></a>

## Mark 11:22

And Jesus answering, saith to them: Have the faith of God.


<a id="org57131c8"></a>

## Mark 11:23

Amen I say to you that whosoever shall say to this mountain, Be thou removed and be cast into the sea, and shall not stagger in his heart, but be believe that whatsoever he saith shall be done; it shall be done unto him.


<a id="orgb835ee4"></a>

## Mark 11:24

Therefore I say unto you, all things, whatsoever you ask when ye pray, believe that you shall receive: and they shall come unto you.


<a id="org1ef0b82"></a>

And when you shall stand to pray, forgive, if you have aught against any man: that your Father also, who is in heaven, may forgive you your sins.


<a id="org8f4bcbc"></a>

But if you will not forgive, neither will your father that is in heaven forgive you your sins.

<a id="org8c47ef1"></a>

And Jesus answering, said to them: I will also ask you one word. And answer you me: and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.


<a id="org0c3dd81"></a>

## Mark 11:30

The baptism of John, was it from heaven or from men? Answer me.


<a id="orgaaf2657"></a>

## Mark 11:31

But they thought with themselves, saying: If we say, From heaven; he will say, Why then did you not believe him?


<a id="org765b831"></a>

## Mark 11:32

If we say, From men, we fear the people. For all men counted John that he was a prophet indeed.


<a id="orgdf884e3"></a>

## Mark 11:33

And they answering, say to Jesus: We know not. And Jesus answering, saith to them: Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.

# Mark 12


<a id="org550de99"></a>

## Mark 12:1

And he began to speak to them in parables: A certain man planted a vineyard and made a hedge about it and dug a place for the winefat and built a tower and let it to husbandmen: and went into a far country.


<a id="orgf53dc71"></a>

## Mark 12:2

And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant to receive of the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard.


<a id="orgf9b5480"></a>

## Mark 12:3

Who, having laid hands on him, beat and sent him away empty.


<a id="org98759a8"></a>

## Mark 12:4

And again he sent to them another servant: and him they wounded in the head and used him reproachfully.


<a id="orga11d8f3"></a>

## Mark 12:5

And again he sent another, and him they killed: and many others, of whom some they beat, and others they killed.


<a id="org43e64a6"></a>

## Mark 12:6

Therefore, having yet one son, most dear to him, he also sent him unto them last of all, saying: They will reverence my son.


<a id="org40380c1"></a>

## Mark 12:7

But the husbandmen said one to another: This is the heir. Come let us kill him and the inheritance shall be ours.


<a id="orgc667df3"></a>

## Mark 12:8

And laying hold on him, they killed him and cast him out of the vineyard.


<a id="org5512e00"></a>

## Mark 12:9

What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy those husbandmen and will give the vineyard to others.


<a id="orgb38fd77"></a>

## Mark 12:10

And have you not read this scripture, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is made the head of the corner:


<a id="orgc3dd9aa"></a>

## Mark 12:11

By the Lord has this been done, and it is wonderful in our eyes.


<a id="orge4836ec"></a>

## Mark 12:12

And they sought to lay hands on him: but they feared the people. For they knew that he spoke this parable to them. And leaving him, they went their way.


<a id="orgf24bad8"></a>

## Mark 12:13

And they sent to him some of the Pharisees and of the Herodians: that they should catch him in his words.


<a id="orga2e3031"></a>

## Mark 12:14

Who coming, say to him: Master, we know that thou art a true speaker and carest not for any man; for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth. Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar? Or shall we not give it?


<a id="orga66e7ef"></a>

## Mark 12:15

Who knowing their wiliness, saith to them: Why tempt you me? Bring me a penny that I may see it.


<a id="org72f0cad"></a>

## Mark 12:16

And they brought it him. And he saith to them: Whose is this image and inscription? They say to him, Caesar&rsquo;s.


<a id="org484a19c"></a>

## Mark 12:17

And Jesus answering, said to them: Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar&rsquo;s and to God the things that are God&rsquo;s. And they marvelled at him.


<a id="org001029c"></a>

## Mark 12:18

And there came to him the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection. And they asked him, saying:


<a id="org45a8964"></a>

## Mark 12:19

Master, Moses wrote unto us that if any man&rsquo;s brother die and leave his wife behind him and leave no children, his brother should take his wife and raise up seed to his brother.


<a id="org9c03957"></a>

## Mark 12:20

Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife and died leaving no issue.


<a id="orge941951"></a>

## Mark 12:21

And the second took her and died: and neither did he leave any issue. And the third in like manner.


<a id="org2851001"></a>

## Mark 12:22

And the seven all took her in like manner and did not leave issue. Last of all the woman also died.


<a id="org808048d"></a>

## Mark 12:23

In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise again, whose wife shall she be of them? For the seven had her to wife.


<a id="org6215594"></a>

## Mark 12:24

And Jesus answering, saith to them: Do ye not therefore err, because you know not the scriptures nor the power of God?


<a id="org758534f"></a>

## Mark 12:25

For when they shall rise again from the dead, they shall neither marry, nor be married, but are as the angels in heaven.


<a id="orgae6250b"></a>

## Mark 12:26

And as concerning the dead that they rise again have you not read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spoke to him, saying: I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob?


<a id="org81232de"></a>

## Mark 12:27

He is not the God of the dead, but of the living. You therefore do greatly err.


<a id="org58d865b"></a>

## Mark 12:28

And there came one of the scribes that had heard them reasoning together, and seeing that he had answered them well, asked him which was the first commandment of all.


<a id="orge1171b1"></a>

## Mark 12:29

And Jesus answered him: The first commandment of all is, Hear, O Israel: the Lord thy God is one God.


<a id="org3b7c020"></a>

## Mark 12:30

And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with thy whole heart and with thy whole soul and with thy whole mind and with thy whole strength. This is the first commandment.


<a id="org3eab775"></a>

## Mark 12:31

And the second is like to it: Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is no other commandment greater than these.


<a id="org984d4bc"></a>

## Mark 12:32

And the scribe said to him: Well, Master, thou hast said in truth that there is one God and there is no other besides him.


<a id="org68b3da8"></a>

## Mark 12:33

And that he should be loved with the whole heart and with the whole understanding and with the whole soul and with the whole strength. And to love one&rsquo;s neighbour as one&rsquo;s self is a greater thing than all holocausts and sacrifices.


<a id="org2c4dbad"></a>

## Mark 12:34

And Jesus seeing that he had answered wisely, said to him: Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that durst ask him any question.


<a id="org30b962e"></a>

## Mark 12:35

And Jesus answering, said, teaching in the temple: How do the scribes say that Christ is the son of David?


<a id="org00ecd01"></a>

## Mark 12:36

For David himself saith by the Holy Ghost: The Lord said to my Lord: Sit on my right hand, until I make thy enemies thy footstool.


<a id="orgce6e24c"></a>

## Mark 12:37

David therefore himself calleth him Lord. And whence is he then his son? And a great multitude heard him gladly.


<a id="orgc26e0c8"></a>

## Mark 12:38

And he said to them in his doctrine: Beware of the scribes, who love to walk in long robes and to be saluted in the marketplace,


<a id="org96f239d"></a>

## Mark 12:39

And to sit in the first chairs in the synagogues and to have the highest places at suppers:


<a id="org284c121"></a>

## Mark 12:40

Who devour the houses of widows under the pretence of long prayer. These shall receive greater judgment.


<a id="orgd3c1072"></a>

## Mark 12:41

And Jesus sitting over against the treasury, beheld how the people cast money into the treasury. And many that were rich cast in much.


<a id="orgbe20f46"></a>

## Mark 12:42

And there came a certain poor widow: and she cast in two mites, which make a farthing.


<a id="org61b2ae9"></a>

## Mark 12:43

And calling his disciples together, he saith to them: Amen I say to you, this poor widow hath cast in more than all they who have cast into the treasury.


<a id="org83d8cd4"></a>

## Mark 12:44

For all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want cast in all she had, even her whole living. 


<a id="orgdcc2d02"></a>

# Mark 13

And as he was going out of the temple, one of his disciples said to him: Master, behold what manner of stones and what buildings are here.


<a id="org412006b"></a>

## Mark 13:2

And Jesus answering, said to him: Seest thou all these great buildings? There shall not be left a stone upon a stone, that shall not be thrown down.


<a id="orge3009ab"></a>

## Mark 13:3

And as he sat on the mount of Olivet over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him apart:


<a id="org3ce5326"></a>

## Mark 13:4

Tell us, when shall these things be and what shall be the sign when all these things shall begin to be fulfilled?


<a id="org56fb3bd"></a>

## Mark 13:5

And Jesus answering, began to say to them: Take heed lest any man deceive you.


<a id="org599e7a9"></a>

## Mark 13:6

For many shall come in my name saying, I am he: and they shall deceive many.


<a id="org06332cb"></a>

## Mark 13:7

And when you shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, fear ye not. For such things must needs be: but the end is not yet.


<a id="org7eb2f67"></a>

## Mark 13:8

For nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in divers places and famines. These things are the beginning of sorrows.


<a id="org6c4289a"></a>

## Mark 13:9

But look to yourselves. For they shall deliver you Up to councils: and in the synagogues you shall be beaten: and you shall stand before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony unto them.


<a id="orgf8e4521"></a>

## Mark 13:10

And unto all nations the gospel must first be preached.


<a id="orgd4369d1"></a>

## Mark 13:11

And when they shall lead you and deliver you up, be not thoughtful beforehand what you shall speak: but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye. For it is not you that speak, but the Holy Ghost.


<a id="org6187fdc"></a>

## Mark 13:12

And the brother shall betray his brother unto death, and the father his son; and children shall rise up against their parents and shall work their death.


<a id="org9bc3332"></a>

## Mark 13:13

And you shall be hated by all men for my name&rsquo;s sake. But he that shall endure unto the end, he shall be saved.


<a id="org3bed4e5"></a>

## Mark 13:14

And when you shall see the abomination of desolation, standing where it ought not (he that readeth let him understand): then let them that are in Judea flee unto the mountains.


<a id="org8c95362"></a>

## Mark 13:15

And let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house nor enter therein to take any thing out of the house.


<a id="org7fd599e"></a>

## Mark 13:16

And let him that shall be in the field not turn back to take up his garment.


<a id="org2ef2c31"></a>

## Mark 13:17

And woe to them that are with child and that give suck in those days.


<a id="orga40ccee"></a>

## Mark 13:18

But pray ye that these things happen not in winter.


<a id="org1205e45"></a>

## Mark 13:19

For in those days shall be such tribulations as were not from the beginning of the creation which God created until now: neither shall be.


<a id="orgb8727b9"></a>

## Mark 13:20

And unless the Lord had shortened the days, no flesh should be saved: but, for the sake of the elect which he hath chosen, he hath shortened the days.


<a id="org4d5bc8c"></a>

## Mark 13:21

And then if any man shall say to you: Lo, here is Christ. Lo, he is here: do not believe.


<a id="org891ea13"></a>

## Mark 13:22

For there will rise up false Christs and false prophets: and they shall shew signs and wonders, to seduce (if it were possible) even the elect.

Take you heed therefore: behold, I have foretold you all things.


<a id="orgb593aa5"></a>

## Mark 13:24

But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened and the moon shall not give her light.


<a id="org9a8bf47"></a>

## Mark 13:25

And the stars of heaven shall be falling down and the powers that are in heaven shall be moved.


<a id="org6076c18"></a>

## Mark 13:26

And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds, with great power and glory.


<a id="orgd4a94f7"></a>

Lest coming on a sudden, he find you sleeping.

And when he was in Bethania, in the house of Simon the leper, and was at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of precious spikenard. And breaking the alabaster box, she poured it out upon his head.

## Mark 14:4

Now there were some that had indignation within themselves and said: Why was this waste of the ointment made?


<a id="orgec5dd46"></a>

## Mark 14:5

For this ointment might have been sold for more than three hundred pence and given to the poor. And they murmured against her.


<a id="orgc215ff3"></a>

## Mark 14:6

But Jesus said: Let her alone. Why do You molest her? She hath wrought a good work upon me.


<a id="org8f42c15"></a>

<a id="org4767e11"></a>
