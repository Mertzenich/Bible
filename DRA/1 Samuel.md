# I Samuel 1


<a id="org770b9dd"></a>

## I Samuel 1:1

There was a man of Ramathaimsophim, of Mount Ephraim, and his name was Elcana, the son of Jeroham, the son of Eliu, the son of Thohu, the son of Suph, an Ephraimite:


<a id="org9e0989a"></a>

## I Samuel 1:2

And he had two wives, the name of one was Anna, and the name of the other Phenenna. Phenenna had children: but Anna had no children.


<a id="orge54f70d"></a>

## I Samuel 1:3

And this man went up out of his city upon the appointed days, to adore and to offer sacrifice to the Lord of hosts in Silo. And the two sons of Heli, Ophni and Phinees, were there priests of the Lord.


<a id="org7fe6500"></a>

## I Samuel 1:4

Now the day came, and Elcana offered sacrifice, and gave to Phenenna, his wife, and to all her sons and daughters, portions:


<a id="orgc127ba7"></a>

## I Samuel 1:5

But to Anna he gave one portion with sorrow, because he loved Anna. And the Lord had shut up her womb.


<a id="org4846aa8"></a>

## I Samuel 1:6

Her rival also afflicted her, and troubled her exceedingly, insomuch that she upbraided her, that the Lord had shut up her womb:


<a id="org1e26713"></a>

## I Samuel 1:7

And thus she did every year, when the time returned, that they went up to the temple of the Lord: and thus she provoked her: but Anna wept, and did not eat.


<a id="org0167572"></a>

## I Samuel 1:8

Then Elcana, her husband, said to her: Anna, why weepest thou? and why dost thou not eat? and why dost thou afflict thy heart? Am not I better to thee than ten children?


<a id="orgaad817a"></a>

## I Samuel 1:9

So Anna arose after she had eaten and drunk in Silo: And Heli, the priest, sitting upon a stool before the door of the temple of the Lord;


<a id="orgd72cb26"></a>

## I Samuel 1:10

As Anna had her heart full of grief, she prayed to the Lord, shedding many tears,


<a id="org90da098"></a>

## I Samuel 1:11

And she made a vow, saying: O Lord of hosts, if thou wilt look down, and wilt be mindful of me, and not forget thy handmaid, and wilt give to thy servant a manchild: I will give him to the Lord all the days of his life, and no razor shall come upon his head.


<a id="orgdf803dc"></a>

## I Samuel 1:12

And it came to pass, as she multiplied prayers before the Lord, that Heli observed her mouth.


<a id="org904c8f5"></a>

## I Samuel 1:13

Now Anna spoke in her heart, and only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard at all. Heli therefore thought her to be drunk,


<a id="orgc5c3372"></a>

## I Samuel 1:14

And said to her: How long wilt thou be drunk? digest a little the wine, of which thou hast taken too much.


<a id="org1c3d3d2"></a>

## I Samuel 1:15

Anna answering, said: Not so, my lord: for I am an exceeding unhappy woman, and have drunk neither wine nor any strong drink, but I have poured out my soul before the Lord.


<a id="orgbfd3580"></a>

## I Samuel 1:16

Count not thy handmaid for one of the daughters of Belial: for out of the abundance of my sorrow and grief have I spoken till now.


<a id="org69298aa"></a>

## I Samuel 1:17

Then Heli said to her: Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition, which thou hast asked of him.


<a id="orgb47d13a"></a>

## I Samuel 1:18

And she said: Would to God thy handmaid may find grace in thy eyes. So the woman went on her way, and ate, and her countenance was no more changed.


<a id="orge70d951"></a>

## I Samuel 1:19

And they rose in the morning, and worshipped before the Lord: and they returned, and came into their house at Ramatha. And Elcana knew Anna his wife: And the Lord remembered her.


<a id="orgc6bc953"></a>

## I Samuel 1:20

And it came to pass when the time was come about, Anna conceived and bore a son, and called his name Samuel: because she had asked him of the Lord.


<a id="orgf2802fe"></a>

## I Samuel 1:21

And Elcana, her husband, went up, and all his house, to offer to the Lord the solemn sacrifice, and his vow.


<a id="orgb3c972e"></a>

## I Samuel 1:22

But Anna went not up: for she said to her husband: I will not go till the child be weaned, and till I may carry him, that he may appear before the Lord, and may abide always there.


<a id="org9f3d31a"></a>

## I Samuel 1:23

And Elcana, her husband, said to her: Do what seemeth good to thee, and stay till thou wean him: and I pray that the Lord may fulfil his word. So the woman staid at home, and gave her son suck, till she weaned him.


<a id="org397d1c8"></a>

## I Samuel 1:24

And after she had weaned him, she carried him with her, with three calves, and three bushels of flour, and a bottle of wine, and she brought him to the house of the Lord in Silo. Now the child was as yet very young:


<a id="orgb515853"></a>

## I Samuel 1:25

And they immolated a calf, and offered the child to Heli.


<a id="org69383ca"></a>

## I Samuel 1:26

And Anna said: I beseech thee, my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord: I am that woman, who stood before thee here praying to the Lord.


<a id="org1e991d2"></a>

## I Samuel 1:27

For this child did I pray, and the Lord hath granted me my petition, which I asked of him.


<a id="orga75fb20"></a>

## I Samuel 1:28

Therefore I also have lent him to the Lord all the days of his life, he shall be lent to the Lord. And they adored the Lord there. And Anna prayed, and said: 


<a id="org926df54"></a>

# I Samuel 2


<a id="org10155f9"></a>

## I Samuel 2:1

My heart hath rejoiced in the Lord, and my horn is exalted in my God: my mouth is enlarged over my enemies: because I have joyed in thy salvation.


<a id="org1aa6120"></a>

## I Samuel 2:2

There is none holy as the Lord is: for there is no other beside thee, and there is none strong like our God.


<a id="orgf02b018"></a>

## I Samuel 2:3

Do not multiply to speak lofty things, boasting: let old matters depart from your mouth: for the Lord is a God of all knowledge, and to him are thoughts prepared.


<a id="org6dbfa51"></a>

## I Samuel 2:4

The bow of the mighty is overcome, and the weak are girt with strength.


<a id="org4b62f30"></a>

## I Samuel 2:5

They that were full before, have hired out themselves for bread: and the hungry are filled, so that the barren hath borne many: and she that had many children is weakened.


<a id="orge3d5b2f"></a>

## I Samuel 2:6

The Lord killeth and maketh alive, he bringeth down to hell, and bringeth back again.


<a id="orgd443f4c"></a>

## I Samuel 2:7

The Lord maketh poor and maketh rich, he humbleth and he exalteth:


<a id="org060872b"></a>

## I Samuel 2:8

He raiseth up the needy from the dust, and lifteth up the poor from the dunghill: that he may sit with princes, and hold the throne of glory. For the poles of the earth are the Lord&rsquo;s, and upon them he hath set the world.


<a id="org80f851b"></a>

## I Samuel 2:9

He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in darkness; because no man shall prevail by his own strength.


<a id="org69b1669"></a>

## I Samuel 2:10

The adversaries of the Lord shall fear him: and upon them shall he thunder in the heavens: The Lord shall judge the ends of the earth, and he shall give empire to his king, and shall exalt the horn of his Christ.


<a id="orgba96a4f"></a>

## I Samuel 2:11

And Elcana went to Ramatha, to his house: but the child ministered in the sight of the Lord before the face of Heli the priest.


<a id="org22360ba"></a>

## I Samuel 2:12

Now the sons of Heli were children of Belial, not knowing the Lord,


<a id="org47e0b80"></a>

## I Samuel 2:13

Nor the office of the priests to the people: but whosoever had offered a sacrifice, the servant of the priest came, while the flesh was in boiling, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand,


<a id="orge7c641e"></a>

## I Samuel 2:14

And thrust it into the kettle, or into the cauldron, or into the pot, or into the pan: and all that the fleshhook brought up, the priest took to himself. Thus did they to all Israel that came to Silo.


<a id="orgffbdbfc"></a>

## I Samuel 2:15

Also before they burnt the fat, the servant of the priest came, and said to the man that sacrificed: Give me flesh to boil for the priest: for I will not take of thee sodden flesh, but raw.


<a id="org5e081b2"></a>

## I Samuel 2:16

And he that sacrificed said to him: Let the fat first be burnt to day, according to the custom, and then take to thee as much as thy soul desireth. But he answered, and said to him: Not so: but thou shalt give it me now, or else I will take it by force.


<a id="orga7b8380"></a>

## I Samuel 2:17

Wherefore the sin of the young men was exceeding great before the Lord: because they withdrew men from the sacrifice of the Lord.


<a id="org1f3ac6e"></a>

## I Samuel 2:18

But Samuel ministered before the face of the Lord: being a child girded with a linen ephod.


<a id="org001d439"></a>

## I Samuel 2:19

And his mother made him a little coat, which she brought to him on the appointed days, when she went up with her husband, to offer the solemn sacrifice.

But thy kingdom shall not continue. The Lord hath sought him a man according to his own heart: and him hath the Lord commanded to be prince over his people, because thou hast not observed that which the Lord commanded.


<a id="orgcfe3b34"></a>

## I Samuel 13:15

And Samuel arose and went up from Galgal to Gabaa of Benjamin. And the rest of the people went up after Saul, to meet the people who fought against them, going from Galgal to Gabaa, in the hill of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people, that were found with him, about six hundred men.


<a id="org1f8a4f1"></a>

## I Samuel 13:16

And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were present with them, were in Gabaa of Benjamin: But the Philistines encamped in Machmas.


<a id="org6d8a98f"></a>

## I Samuel 13:17

And there went out of the camp of the Philistines three companies to plunder. One company went towards the way of Ephra to the land of Sual;


<a id="org41f6656"></a>

## I Samuel 13:18

And another went by the way of Bethoron, and the third turned to the way of the border, above the valley of Seboim towards the desert.


<a id="org3a7e3d1"></a>

## I Samuel 13:19

Now there was no smith to be found in all the land of Israel, for the Philistines had taken this precaution, lest the Hebrews should make them swords or spears.


<a id="orgb3e75ab"></a>

## I Samuel 13:20

So all Israel went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his ploughshare, and his spade, and his axe, and his rake.


<a id="org5720dc3"></a>

## I Samuel 13:21

So that their shares, and their spades, and their forks, and their axes, were blunt, even to the goad, which was to be mended.


<a id="org64ca7d8"></a>

## I Samuel 13:22

And when the day of battle was come, there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan, except Saul and Jonathan his son.


<a id="org5677fb9"></a>

## I Samuel 13:23

And the army of the Philistines went out in order to advance further in Machmas. 


<a id="org205c821"></a>

# I Samuel 14


<a id="orgc63a7c6"></a>

## I Samuel 14:1

Now it came to pass one day that Jonathan, the son of Saul, said to the young man that bore his armour: Come, and let us go over to the garrison of the Philistines, which is on the other side of yonder place. But he told not this to his father.


<a id="orge332fe3"></a>

## I Samuel 14:2

And Saul abode in the uttermost part of Gabaa, under the pomegranate tree, which was in Magron: and the people with him were about six hundred men.


<a id="org017b7d9"></a>

## I Samuel 14:3

And Achias, the son of Achitob, brother of Ichabod the son of Phinees, the son of Heli, the priest of the Lord in Silo, wore the ephod. And the people knew not whither Jonathan was gone.


<a id="orga62c2bb"></a>

## I Samuel 14:4

Now there were between the ascents, by which Jonathan sought to go over to the garrison of the Philistines, rocks standing up on both sides, and steep cliffs like teeth on the one side, and on the other, the name of the one was Boses, and the name of the other was Sene:


<a id="org8cefc7e"></a>

## I Samuel 14:5

One rock stood out toward the north, over against Machmas, and the other to the south, over against Gabaa.


<a id="org919fa3f"></a>

## I Samuel 14:6

And Jonathan said to the young man that bore his armour: Come, let us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised, it may be the Lord will do for us: because it is easy for the Lord to save either by many, or by few.


<a id="org8562456"></a>

## I Samuel 14:7

And his armourbearer said to him: Do all that pleaseth thy mind: go whither thou wilt, and I will be with thee wheresoever thou hast a mind.


<a id="orgfcd9e80"></a>

## I Samuel 14:8

And Jonathan said: Behold we will go over to these men. And when we shall be seen by them,


<a id="org4c39128"></a>

## I Samuel 14:9

If they shall speak thus to us: Stay till we come to you: let us stand still in our place, and not go up to them.


<a id="org20db157"></a>

## I Samuel 14:10

But if they shall say: Come up to us: let us go up, because the Lord hath delivered them into our hands, this shall be a sign unto us.


<a id="org8aed87b"></a>

## I Samuel 14:11

So both of them discovered themselves to the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said: Behold the Hebrews come forth out of the holes wherein they were hid.


<a id="orgf48e750"></a>

## I Samuel 14:12

And the men of the garrison spoke to Jonathan, and to his armourbearer, and said: Come up to us, and we will shew you a thing. And Jonathan said to his armourbearer: Let us go up, follow me: for the Lord hath delivered them into the hands of Israel.


<a id="org839ffa8"></a>

## I Samuel 14:13

And Jonathan went up creeping on his hands and feet, and his armourbearer after him. And some fell before Jonathan, others his armourbearer slew as he followed him.


<a id="orge980d25"></a>

## I Samuel 14:14

And the first slaughter which Jonathan and his armourbearer made, was of about twenty men, within half an acre of land, which a yoke of oxen is wont to plough in a day.


<a id="org561f0b7"></a>

## I Samuel 14:15

And there was a miracle in the camp, in the fields: and all the people of their garrison, who had gone out to plunder, were amazed, and the earth trembled: and it happened as a miracle from God.


<a id="org8b7e577"></a>

## I Samuel 14:16

And the watchmen of Saul, who were in Gabaa of Benjamin looked, and behold a multitude overthrown, and fleeing this way and that.


<a id="org8d9cc2c"></a>

## I Samuel 14:17

And Saul said to the people that were with him: Look, and see who is gone from us. And when they had sought, it was found that Jonathan and his armourbearer were not there.


<a id="org727cee1"></a>

## I Samuel 14:18

And Saul said to Achias: Bring the ark of the Lord. (For the ark of God was there that day with the children of Israel.)


<a id="org8208c56"></a>

## I Samuel 14:19

And while Saul spoke to the priest, there arose a great uproar in the camp of the Philistines: and it increased by degrees, and was heard more clearly. And Saul said to the priest: Draw in thy hand.


<a id="org386083c"></a>

## I Samuel 14:20

Then Saul, and all the people that were with him, shouted together, and they came to the place of the fight: and behold every man&rsquo;s sword was turned upon his neighbour, and there was a very great slaughter.


<a id="orgb982a5f"></a>

## I Samuel 14:21

Moreover, the Hebrews that had been with the Philistines yesterday and the day before, and went up with them into the camp, returned to be with the Israelites, who were with Saul and Jonathan.


<a id="org5b91573"></a>

## I Samuel 14:22

And all the Israelites that had hid themselves in mount Ephraim, hearing that the Philistines fled, joined themselves with their countrymen in the fight. And there were with Saul about ten thousand men.


<a id="org01d3843"></a>

## I Samuel 14:23

And the Lord saved Israel that day. And the fight went on as far as Bethaven.


<a id="org3845d64"></a>

## I Samuel 14:24

And the men of Israel were joined together that day: and Saul adjured the people, saying: Cursed be the man that shall eat food till evening, till I be revenged of my enemies. So none of the people tasted any food.


<a id="orge3d4e25"></a>

## I Samuel 14:25

And all the common people came into a forest, in which there was honey upon the ground.


<a id="org65299c6"></a>

## I Samuel 14:26

And when the people came into the forest, behold the honey dropped, but no man put his hand to his mouth. For the people feared the oath.


<a id="orgbe14924"></a>

## I Samuel 14:27

But Jonathan had not heard when his father adjured the people: and he put forth the end of the rod, which he had in his hand, and dipt it in a honeycomb: and he carried his hand to his mouth, and his eyes were enlightened.


<a id="orge540ef3"></a>

## I Samuel 14:28

And one of the people answering, said: Thy father hath bound the people with an oath, saying: Cursed be the man that shall eat any food this day. (And the people were faint.)


<a id="orge8fdb8e"></a>

## I Samuel 14:29

And Jonathan said: My father hath troubled the land: you have seen yourselves that my eyes are enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey:


<a id="orgf15f53f"></a>

## I Samuel 14:30

How much more if the people had eaten of the prey of their enemies, which they found? had there not been made a greater slaughter among the Philistines?


<a id="orgd61c20e"></a>

## I Samuel 14:31

So they smote that day the Philistines, from Machmas to Aialon. And the people were wearied exceedingly.


<a id="org0a648b2"></a>

## I Samuel 14:32

And falling upon the spoils, they took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slew them on the ground: and the people ate them with the blood.


<a id="org03de538"></a>

## I Samuel 14:33

And they told Saul that the people had sinned against the Lord, eating with the blood. And he said: You have transgressed: roll here to me now a great stone.


<a id="orga7de78e"></a>

## I Samuel 14:34

And Saul said: Disperse yourselves among the people, and tell them to bring me every man his ox and his ram and slay them upon this stone, and eat, and you shall not sin against the Lord, in eating with the blood. So all the people brought every man his ox with him till the night: and slew them there.


<a id="org5432bc8"></a>

## I Samuel 14:35

And Saul built an altar to the Lord: and he then first began to build an altar to the Lord.


<a id="org950736f"></a>

## I Samuel 14:36

And Saul said: Let us fall upon the Philistines by night, and destroy them till the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And the people said: Do all that seemeth good in thy eyes. And the priest said: Let us draw near hither unto God.


<a id="org20827ae"></a>

## I Samuel 14:37

And Saul consulted the Lord: Shall I pursue after the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into the hands of Israel? And he answered him not that day.


<a id="orgbc53768"></a>

## I Samuel 14:38

And Saul said: Bring hither all the corners of the people: and know, and see by whom this sin hath happened to day.


<a id="orgafcee4f"></a>

## I Samuel 14:39

As the Lord liveth, who is the Saviour of Israel, if it was done by Jonathan, my son, he shall surely die. In this none of the people gainsayed him.


<a id="org721a154"></a>

## I Samuel 14:40

And he said to all Israel: Be you on one side and I, with Jonathan, my son, will be on the other side. And the people answered Saul: Do what seemeth good in thy eyes.


<a id="org5dfd0c6"></a>

## I Samuel 14:41

And Saul said to the Lord: O Lord God of Israel, give a sign, by which we may know, what the meaning is, that thou answerest not thy servant to day: If this iniquity be in me, or in my son Jonathan, give a proof: or if this iniquity be in thy people, give holiness. And Jonathan and Saul were taken, and the people escaped.


<a id="org228d251"></a>

## I Samuel 14:42

And Saul said: (Cast lots between me, and Jonathan, my son. And Jonathan was taken.


<a id="org49a1389"></a>

## I Samuel 14:43

And Saul said to Jonathan: Tell me what thou hast done. And Jonathan told him, and said: I did but taste a little honey with the end of the rod, which was in my hand, and behold I must die.


<a id="org174b895"></a>

## I Samuel 14:44

And Saul said: May God do so and so to me, and add still more: for dying thou shalt die, O Jonathan.


<a id="orgbd8bbd2"></a>

## I Samuel 14:45

And the people said to Saul: Shall Jonathan then die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel? this must not be: As the Lord liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground, for he hath wrought with God this day. So the people delivered Jonathan, that he should not die.


<a id="org7e45215"></a>

## I Samuel 14:46

And Saul went back, and did not pursue after the Philistines: and the Philistines went to their own places.


<a id="orgd574cee"></a>

## I Samuel 14:47

And Saul having his kingdom established over Israel, fought against all his enemies round about, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and Edom, and the kings of Soba, and the Philistines: and whithersoever he turned himself, he overcame.


<a id="org9fc109b"></a>

## I Samuel 14:48

And gathering together an army, he defeated Amalec, and delivered Israel from the hand of them that spoiled them.


<a id="org1c23d96"></a>

## I Samuel 14:49

And the sons of Saul, were Jonathan, and Jessui, and Melchisua: and the names of his two daughters, the name of the firstborn was Merob, and the name of the younger Michol.


<a id="orgf3b938b"></a>

## I Samuel 14:50

And the name of Saul&rsquo;s wife was Achinoam, the daughter of Achimaas; and the name of the captain of his army was Abner, the son of Ner, the cousin german of Saul.


<a id="orge84b0f8"></a>

## I Samuel 14:51

For Cis was the father of Saul, and Ner, the father of Abner, was son of Abiel.


<a id="org3e0bed9"></a>

## I Samuel 14:52

And there was a great war against the Philistines all the days of Saul. For whomsoever Saul saw to be a valiant man, and fit for war, he took him to himself. 


<a id="org386b7b0"></a>

# I Samuel 15


<a id="org783fb9f"></a>

## I Samuel 15:1

And Samuel said to Saul: The Lord sent me to anoint thee king over his people Israel: now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the Lord:


<a id="org7a52d77"></a>

## I Samuel 15:2

Thus saith the Lord of hosts: I have reckoned up all that Amalec hath done to Israel: how he opposed them in the way when they came up out of Egypt.


<a id="org49069d0"></a>

## I Samuel 15:3

Now therefore go, and smite Amalec, and utterly destroy all that he hath: spare him not, nor covet anything that is his: but slay both man and woman, child and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.


<a id="orgf91e351"></a>

## I Samuel 15:4

So Saul commanded the people, and numbered them as lambs: two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand of the men of Juda.

And when Saul was come to the city of Amalec, he laid ambushes in the torrent.


<a id="org2948320"></a>

## I Samuel 15:6

And Saul said to the Cinite: Go, depart, and get ye down from Amalec: lest I destroy thee with him. For thou hast shewn kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt. And the Cinite departed from the midst of Amalec.


<a id="org60249ff"></a>

## I Samuel 15:7

And Saul smote Amalec from Hevila, until thou comest to Sur, which is over against Egypt.


<a id="org3fd12be"></a>

## I Samuel 15:8

And he took Agag, the king of Amalec, alive: but all the common people he slew with the edge of the sword.


<a id="orgcc29c46"></a>

## I Samuel 15:9

And Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the flocks of sheep, and of the herds, and the garments and the rams, and all that was beautiful, and would not destroy them: but every thing that was vile, and good for nothing, that they destroyed.


<a id="org3e8959d"></a>

## I Samuel 15:10

And the word of the Lord came to Samuel,


<a id="orgd865790"></a>

## I Samuel 15:11

It repenteth me that I have made Saul king: for he hath forsaken me, and hath not executed my commandments. And Samuel was grieved, and he cried unto the Lord all night.


<a id="org53dd3c2"></a>

## I Samuel 15:12

And when Samuel rose early, to go to Saul in the morning, it was told Samuel that Saul was come to Carmel, and had erected for himself a triumphant arch, and returning had passed on, and gone down to Galgal. And Samuel came to Saul, and Saul was offering a holocaust to the Lord, out of the choicest of the spoils, which he had brought from Amalec.


<a id="org4b7ec3e"></a>

## I Samuel 15:13

And when Samuel was come to Saul, Saul said to him: Blessed be thou of the Lord, I have fulfilled the word of the Lord.


<a id="orgc61fb43"></a>

## I Samuel 15:14

And Samuel said: What meaneth then this bleating of the flocks, which soundeth in my ears, and the lowing of the herds, which I hear?


<a id="orge64311d"></a>

## I Samuel 15:15

And Saul said: They have brought them from Amalec: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the herds, that they might be sacrificed to the Lord thy God, but the rest we have slain.


<a id="orgf1b84ea"></a>

## I Samuel 15:16

And Samuel said to Saul: Suffer me, and I will tell thee what the Lord hath said to me this night. And he said to him: Speak.


<a id="orge509c48"></a>

## I Samuel 15:17

And Samuel said: When thou wast a little one in thy own eyes, wast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel? And the Lord anointed thee to be king over Israel.


<a id="org65d4acb"></a>

## I Samuel 15:18

And the Lord sent thee on the way, and said: Go, and kill the sinners of Amalec, and thou shalt fight against them until thou hast utterly destroyed them.


<a id="org0a7daca"></a>

Why then didst thou not hearken to the voice of the Lord: but hast turned to the prey, and hast done evil in the eyes of the Lord?


<a id="orgb989cc9"></a>

## I Samuel 15:20

And Saul said to Samuel: Yea, I have hearkened to the voice of the Lord, and have walked in the way by which the Lord sent me, and have brought Agag, the king of Amalec, and Amalec I have slain.


<a id="org15104fe"></a>

## I Samuel 15:21

But the people took of the spoils, sheep and oxen, as the firstfruits of those things that were slain, to offer sacrifice to the Lord their God in Galgal.


<a id="orga2c5e4f"></a>

## I Samuel 15:22

And Samuel said: Doth the Lord desire holocausts and victims, and not rather that the voice of the Lord should be obeyed? For obedience is better than sacrifices: and to hearken rather than to offer the fat or rams.


<a id="org25a3edc"></a>

## I Samuel 15:23

Because it is like the sin of witchcraft, to rebel: and like the crime of idolatry, to refuse to obey. Forasmuch, therefore, as thou hast rejected the word of the Lord, the Lord hath also rejected thee from being king.


<a id="org7f8446a"></a>

## I Samuel 15:24

And Saul said to Samuel: I have sinned, because I have transgressed the commandment of the Lord, and thy words, fearing the people, and obeying their voice.


<a id="orgc8de9c2"></a>

## I Samuel 15:25

But now bear, I beseech thee, my sin, and return with me, that I may adore the Lord.


<a id="orgd9dc2c8"></a>

## I Samuel 15:26

<a id="org059d797"></a>

## I Samuel 15:27

And Samuel turned about to go away: but he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle, and it rent.


<a id="org2bad5a4"></a>

## I Samuel 15:28

And Samuel said to him: The Lord hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to thy neighbour who is better than thee.


<a id="orgc1a91ee"></a>

## I Samuel 15:29

But the triumpher in Israel will not spare, and will not be moved to repentance: for he is not a man that he should repent.


<a id="orgcfebac7"></a>

## I Samuel 15:30

Then he said: I have sinned: yet honour me now before the ancients of my people, and before Israel, and return with me, that I may adore the Lord thy God.


<a id="org5ce3146"></a>

## I Samuel 15:31

So Samuel turned again after Saul: and Saul adored the Lord.


<a id="org2f20471"></a>

## I Samuel 15:32

And Samuel said: Bring hither to me Agag, the king of Amalec. And Agag was presented to him very fat, and trembling. And Agag said: Doth bitter death separate in this manner?


<a id="orgcf8db84"></a>

## I Samuel 15:33

And Samuel said: As thy sword hath made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed him in pieces before the Lord in Galgal.

And Samuel departed to Ramatha: but Saul went up to his house in Gabaa.


<a id="org0357477"></a>

<a id="org5a887f0"></a>

## I Samuel 16:1

And the Lord said to Samuel: How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, whom I have rejected from reigning over Israel? fill thy horn with oil, and come, that I may send thee to Isai, the Bethlehemite: for I have provided me a king among his sons.


<a id="org1b1ef67"></a>

## I Samuel 16:2

And Samuel said: How shall I go? for Saul will hear of it, and he will kill me. And the Lord said: Thou shalt take with thee a calf of the herd, and thou shalt say: I am come to sacrifice to the Lord.


<a id="orge9f1993"></a>

## I Samuel 16:3

And thou shalt call Isai to the sacrifice, and I will shew thee what thou art to do, and thou shalt anoint him whom I shall shew to thee.


<a id="orgd1ba780"></a>

## I Samuel 16:4

Then Samuel did as the Lord had said to him. And he came to Bethlehem, and the ancients of the city wondered, and meeting him, they said: Is thy coming hither peaceable?


<a id="org529e5ee"></a>

## I Samuel 16:5

And he said: It is peaceable: I am come to offer sacrifice to the Lord, be ye sanctified, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Isai and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.

## I Samuel 16:6

And when they were come in, he saw Eliab, and said: Is the Lord&rsquo;s anointed before him?


<a id="orgb1c55d2"></a>

## I Samuel 16:7

And the Lord said to Samuel: Look not on his countenance, nor on the height of his stature: because I have rejected him, nor do I judge according to the look of man: for man seeth those things that appear, but the Lord beholdeth the heart.


<a id="org1d9b65f"></a>

## I Samuel 16:8

And Isai called Abinadab, and brought him before Samuel. And he said: Neither hath the Lord chosen this,


<a id="org9890105"></a>

## I Samuel 16:9

And Isai brought Samma, and he said of him: Neither hath the Lord chosen this.


<a id="orgb4d6f11"></a>

## I Samuel 16:10

Isai therefore brought his seven sons before Samuel: and Samuel said to Isai: The Lord hath not chosen any one of these.


<a id="orgee3e73a"></a>

## I Samuel 16:11

And Samuel said to Isai: Are here all thy sons? He answered: There remaineth yet a young one, who keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said to Isai: Send, and fetch him: for we will not sit down till he come hither.


<a id="org77e67f3"></a>

## I Samuel 16:12

He sent therefore and brought him. Now he was ruddy and beautiful to behold, and of a comely face. And the Lord said: Arise, and anoint him, for this is he.


<a id="org9142255"></a>

## I Samuel 16:13

Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the Lord came upon David from that day forward: and Samuel rose up, and went to Ramatha.


<a id="org935763f"></a>

## I Samuel 16:14

But the Spirit of the Lord departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the Lord troubled him.


<a id="org1f41757"></a>

## I Samuel 16:15

And the servants of Saul said to him: Behold now an evil spirit from God troubleth thee.


<a id="org9864e45"></a>

## I Samuel 16:16

Let our lord give orders, and thy servants who are before thee, will seek out a man skilful in playing on the harp, that when the evil spirit from the Lord is upon thee, he may play with his hand, and thou mayst bear it more easily.


<a id="org21449f0"></a>

## I Samuel 16:17

And Saul said to his servants: Provide me then some man that can play well, and bring him to me.


<a id="org43f21b3"></a>

## I Samuel 16:18

And one of the servants answering, said: Behold I have seen a son of Isai, the Bethlehemite, a skilful player, and one of great strength, and a man fit for war, and prudent in his words, and a comely person: and the Lord is with him.


<a id="orgd4935a0"></a>

Then Saul sent messengers to Isai, saying: Send me David, thy son, who is in the pastures.


<a id="orgbbcacff"></a>

## I Samuel 16:20

<a id="org68e0f55"></a>

## I Samuel 17:5

And he had a helmet of brass upon his head, and he was clothed with a coat of mail with scales, and the weight of his coat of mail was five thousand sicles of brass:

## I Samuel 17:8

And standing, he cried out to the bands of Israel, and said to them: Why are you come out prepared to fight? am not I a Philistine, and you the servants of Saul? Choose out a man of you, and let him come down and fight hand to hand.


<a id="orgd1cf947"></a>

## I Samuel 17:9

## I Samuel 17:13

And his three eldest sons followed Saul to the battle: and the names of his three sons that went to the battle, were Eliab, the firstborn, and the second, Abinadab, and the third Samma:


<a id="org799f32d"></a>

## I Samuel 17:14

But David was the youngest. So the three eldest having followed Saul,


<a id="orgaa96a2e"></a>

## I Samuel 17:15

David went, and returned from Saul, to feed his father&rsquo;s flock at Bethlehem.


<a id="org410ebba"></a>

<a id="org90b86c8"></a>

## I Samuel 17:21

<a id="orgb7dbbf3"></a>

## I Samuel 17:22

And David leaving the vessels which he had brought, under the care of the keeper of the baggage, ran to the place of the battle, and asked if all things went well with his brethren.


<a id="orged7a6cc"></a>

## I Samuel 17:23

And as he talked with them, that baseborn man, whose name was Goliath, the Philistine, of Geth, shewed himself coming up from the camp of the Philistines: and he spoke according to the same words, and David heard them,


<a id="orged04c9c"></a>

## I Samuel 17:24

And all the Israelites, when they saw the man, fled from his face, fearing him exceedingly.


<a id="orgfd8f632"></a>

<a id="org412cf9f"></a>

## I Samuel 17:26

And David spoke to the men that stood by him, saying: What shall be given to the man that shall kill this Philistine, and shall take away the reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?


<a id="orgae79de5"></a>

## I Samuel 17:27

And the people answered him the same words, saying: These things shall be given to the man that shall slay him.


<a id="org1a5d2c7"></a>

## I Samuel 17:28

Now when Eliab his eldest brother heard this, when he was speaking with others, he was angry with David, and said: Why camest thou hither? and why didst thou leave those few sheep in the desert? I know thy pride, and the wickedness of thy heart: that thou art come down to see the battle.


<a id="org6ea6dee"></a>

## I Samuel 17:29

And David said: What have I done? is there not cause to speak?


<a id="orge653cf1"></a>

## I Samuel 17:34

And David said to Saul: Thy servant kept his father&rsquo;s sheep, and there came a lion, or a bear, and took a ram out of the midst of the flock:


<a id="orgb04025d"></a>

## I Samuel 17:35

And I pursued after them, and struck them, and delivered it out of their mouth: and they rose up against me, and I caught them by the throat, and I strangled, and killed them.


<a id="org68d8221"></a>

## I Samuel 17:36

For I thy servant have killed both a lion and a bear: and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be also as one of them. I will go now, and take away the reproach of the people: for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, who hath dared to curse the army of the living God?


<a id="orgc41e6b5"></a>

## I Samuel 17:37

And David said: The Lord who delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said to David: Go, and the Lord be with thee.


<a id="orgd760c1b"></a>

<a id="org4bef4cf"></a>

## I Samuel 17:39

And David having girded his sword upon his armour, began to try if he could walk in armour: for he was not accustomed to it. And David said to Saul: I cannot go thus, for I am not used to it. And he laid them off,


<a id="orgce9b976"></a>

## I Samuel 17:40

And he took his staff, which he had always in his hands: and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them into the shepherd&rsquo;s scrip, which he had with him, and he took a sling in his hand, and went forth against the Philistine.


<a id="org4821ed1"></a>

<a id="orga7bc97b"></a>

<a id="org9f9a7ab"></a>

And the Philistine said to David: Am I a dog, that thou comest to me with a staff? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.

## I Samuel 17:46

This day, and the Lord will deliver thee into my hand, and I will slay thee, and take away thy head from thee: and I will give the carcasses of the army of the Philistines this day to the birds of the air, and to the beasts of the earth: that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel.


<a id="org08731b9"></a>

He ran, and stood over the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath, and slew him, and cut off his head. And the Philistines seeing that their champion was dead, fled away.

<a id="org30d52c6"></a>

## I Samuel 17:56

And the king said: Inquire thou, whose son this young man is.


<a id="org82c1829"></a>

## I Samuel 17:57

## I Samuel 18:2

And Saul took him that day, and would not let him return to his father&rsquo;s house.

<a id="org2625ffb"></a>

## I Samuel 18:4

<a id="org9de1c96"></a>

## I Samuel 18:5

And David went out to whatsoever business Saul sent him, and he behaved himself prudently: and Saul set him over the soldiers, and he was acceptable in the eyes of all the people, and especially in the eyes of Saul&rsquo;s servants.


<a id="org8958545"></a>

## I Samuel 18:6

<a id="org263bd9c"></a>

## I Samuel 18:7

And the women sung as they played, and they said: Saul slew his thousands, and David his ten thousands.


<a id="org886023d"></a>

## I Samuel 18:8

And Saul was exceeding angry, and this word was displeasing in his eyes, and he said: They have given David ten thousands, and to me they have given but a thousand, what can he have more but the kingdom?


<a id="org91776a8"></a>

## I Samuel 18:9

And Saul did not look on David with a good eye from that day and forward.


<a id="org529cd87"></a>

## I Samuel 18:10

<a id="orgf2fb043"></a>

## I Samuel 18:11

And threw it, thinking to nail David to the wall: and David stept aside out of his presence twice.


<a id="org68aacf6"></a>

## I Samuel 18:12

And Saul feared David, because the Lord was with him, and was departed from Saul himself.


<a id="org56e8914"></a>

## I Samuel 18:13

Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him a captain over a thousand men, and he went out and came in before the people.


<a id="org1a5bc11"></a>

## I Samuel 18:14

And David behaved wisely in all his ways, and the Lord was with him.


<a id="org36f133a"></a>

## I Samuel 18:15

And Saul saw that he was exceeding prudent, and began to beware of him.


<a id="orged7f59e"></a>

## I Samuel 18:16

But all Israel and Juda loved David, for he came in and went out before them.


<a id="orgf7d3126"></a>

## I Samuel 18:17

And Saul said to David: Behold my elder daughter Merob, her will I give thee to wife: only be a valiant man, and fight the battles of the Lord. Now Saul said within himself: Let not my hand be upon him, but let the hands of the Philistines be upon him.


<a id="orgbc47aac"></a>

## I Samuel 18:18

And David said to Saul: Who am I, or what is my life, or my father&rsquo;s family in Israel, that I should be son in law of the king?


<a id="org227eec6"></a>

## I Samuel 18:19

And it came to pass at the time when Merob, the daughter of Saul, should have been given to David, that she was given to Hadriel, the Molathite, to wife.

<a id="org25ee60f"></a>

## I Samuel 18:21

And Saul said: I will give her to him, that she may be a stumblingblock to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be upon him. And Saul said to David: In two things thou shalt be my son in law this day.


<a id="org89c1eb4"></a>

## I Samuel 18:22

And Saul commanded his servants to speak to David privately, saying: Behold, thou pleasest the king, and all his servants love thee. Now, therefore be the king&rsquo;s son in law.


<a id="orgf13c30c"></a>

## I Samuel 18:23

And the servants of Saul spoke all these words in the ear of David. And David said: Doth it seem to you a small matter to be the king&rsquo;s son in law? But I am a poor man, and of small ability.


<a id="org56f33af"></a>

## I Samuel 18:24

And the servants of Saul told him, saying: Such words as these hath David spoken.


<a id="orgb47c4c7"></a>

## I Samuel 18:25

And Saul said: Speak thus to David: The king desireth not any dowry, but only a hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king&rsquo;s enemies. Now Saul thought to deliver David into the hands of the Philistines.


<a id="org9fcd736"></a>

## I Samuel 18:26

And when his servants had told David the words that Saul had said, the word was pleasing in the eyes of David to be the king&rsquo;s son in law.


<a id="orgd230581"></a>

## I Samuel 18:27

And after a few days David rose up, and went with the men that were under him, and he slew of the Philistines two hundred men, and brought their foreskins and numbered them out to the king, that he might be his son in law. Saul therefore gave him Michol, his daughter, to wife.


<a id="org9933686"></a>

And Jonathan spoke good things of David to Saul, his father: and said to him: Sin not, O king, against thy servant, David, because he hath not sinned against thee, and his works are very good towards thee.


<a id="org585ac63"></a>

## I Samuel 19:5

And he put his life in his hand, and slew the Philistine, and the Lord wrought great salvation for all Israel. Thou sawest it and didst rejoice. Why therefore wilt thou sin against innocent blood, by killing David, who is without fault?


<a id="org65a19bd"></a>

## I Samuel 19:11

Saul therefore sent his guards to David&rsquo;s house to watch him, that he might be killed in the morning. And when Michol, David&rsquo;s wife, had told him this, saying: Unless thou save thyself this night, to morrow thou wilt die:

Went also himself to Ramatha, and came as far as the great cistern, which is in Socho, and he asked, and said: In what place are Samuel and David? And it was told him: Behold they are in Najoth, in Ramatha.

And he said to him: (God forbid, thou shalt not die: for my father will do nothing, great or little, without first telling me: hath then my father hid this word only from me? no, this shall not be.

## I Samuel 20:3

And he swore again to David. And David said: Thy father certainly knoweth that I have found grace in thy sight, and he will say: Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved. But truly as the Lord liveth, and thy soul liveth, there is but one step (as I may say) between me and death.

Jonathan said to David: O Lord God of Israel, if I shall discover my father&rsquo;s mind, to morrow, or the day after, and there be any thing good for David, and I send not immediately to thee, and make it known to thee,


<a id="orge4ddbe3"></a>

## I Samuel 20:13

May the Lord do so and so to Jonathan, and add still more. But if my father shall continue in malice against thee, I will discover it to thy ear, and will send thee away, that thou mayst go in peace, and the Lord be with thee, as he hath been with my father.


<a id="org8092148"></a>

## I Samuel 20:14

And if I live, thou shalt shew me the kindness of the Lord: but if I die,


<a id="orge94763a"></a>

## I Samuel 20:15

Thou shalt not take away thy kindness from my house for ever, when the Lord shall have rooted out the enemies of David, every one of them from the earth, may he take away Jonathan from his house, and may the Lord require it at the hands of David&rsquo;s enemies.


<a id="orgb8aeeb6"></a>

## I Samuel 20:16

Jonathan therefore made a covenant with the house of David: and the Lord required it at the hands of David&rsquo;s enemies.


<a id="org02363e7"></a>

## I Samuel 20:17

And Jonathan swore again to David, because he loved him: for he loved him as his own soul.


<a id="orgc453037"></a>

## I Samuel 20:18

And Jonathan said to him: To morrow is the new moon, and thou wilt be missed:


<a id="orgd58bf65"></a>

## I Samuel 20:19

For thy seat will be empty till after to morrow. So thou shalt go down quickly, and come to the place where thou must he hid, on the day when it is lawful to work, and thou shalt remain beside the stone, which is called Ezel.


<a id="orge19b7be"></a>

## I Samuel 20:20

And I will shoot three arrows near it, and will shoot as if I were exercising myself at a mark.


<a id="org8ba86e4"></a>

## I Samuel 20:21

And I will send a boy, saying to him: Go and fetch me the arrows.


<a id="orgd031953"></a>

## I Samuel 20:22

If I shall say to the boy: Behold the arrows are on this side of thee, take them up: come thou to me, because there is peace to thee, and there is no evil, as the Lord liveth. But if I shall speak thus to the boy: Behold the arrows are beyond thee: go in peace, for the Lord hath sent thee away.


<a id="org39a4a51"></a>

## I Samuel 20:23

And concerning the word which I and thou have spoken, the Lord be between thee and me forever.


<a id="org8fa529e"></a>

## I Samuel 20:24

So David was hid in the field, and the new moon came, and the king sat down to eat bread.


<a id="orgea34679"></a>

## I Samuel 20:25

And when the king sat down upon his chair, (according to custom) which was beside the wall, Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul&rsquo;s side, and David&rsquo;s place appeared empty.


<a id="org26d4b9b"></a>

## I Samuel 20:26

And Saul said nothing that day, for he thought it might have happened to him, that he was not clean, nor purified.


<a id="org44ba8fd"></a>

## I Samuel 20:27

And when the second day after the new moon was come, David&rsquo;s place appeared empty again. And Saul said to Jonathan, his son: Why cometh not the son of Isai to meat neither yesterday, nor to day?


<a id="org71e4918"></a>

## I Samuel 20:28

And Jonathan answered Saul: He asked leave of me earnestly to go to Bethlehem.


<a id="org36ce1b8"></a>

## I Samuel 20:29

And he said: Let me go, for there is a solemn sacrifice in the city, one of my brethren hath sent for me: and now if I have found favour in thy eyes, I will go quickly, and see my brethren. For this cause he came not to the king&rsquo;s table.


<a id="org6e5e573"></a>

## I Samuel 20:30

Then Saul being angry against Jonathan, said to him: Thou son of a woman that is the ravisher of a man, do I not know that thou lovest the son of Isai to thy own confusion, and to the confusion of thy shameless mother?


<a id="org3977c5f"></a>

## I Samuel 20:31

For as long as the son of Isai liveth upon earth, thou shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom. Therefore now presently send, and fetch him to me: for he is the son of death.


<a id="org035e4f0"></a>

## I Samuel 20:32

And Jonathan answering Saul, his father, said: Why shall he die? What hath he done?


<a id="org08c2749"></a>

## I Samuel 20:33

And Saul caught up a spear to strike him. And Jonathan understood that it was determined by his father to kill David.


<a id="org4e1d948"></a>

## I Samuel 20:34

So Jonathan rose from the table in great anger, and did not eat bread on the second day after the new moon. For he was grieved for David, because his father had put him to confusion.


<a id="org219598d"></a>

## I Samuel 20:35

And when the morning came, Jonathan went into the field according to the appointment with David, and a little boy with him.


<a id="orgf64e408"></a>

## I Samuel 20:36

And he said to his boy: Go, and fetch me the arrows which I shoot. And when the boy ran, he shot another arrow beyond the boy.


<a id="org5be66ce"></a>

## I Samuel 20:37

The boy therefore came to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot: and Jonathan cried after the boy, and said: Behold the arrow is there further beyond thee.


<a id="orgbead094"></a>

## I Samuel 20:38

And Jonathan cried again after the boy, saying: Make haste speedily, stand not. And Jonathan&rsquo;s boy gathered up the arrows, and brought them to his master:


<a id="org6e36188"></a>

## I Samuel 20:39

And he knew not at all what was doing: for only Jonathan and David knew the matter.


<a id="org456b6b6"></a>

## I Samuel 20:40

Jonathan therefore gave his arms to the boy, and said to him: Go, and carry them into the city.


<a id="org88cda89"></a>

## I Samuel 20:41

And when the boy was gone, David rose out of his place, which was toward the south, and falling on his face to the ground, adored thrice: and kissing one another, they wept together; but David more.


<a id="org7c7c837"></a>

## I Samuel 20:42

And Jonathan said to David: Go in peace: and let all stand that we have sworn both of us in the name of the Lord, saying: The Lord be between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed for ever.


<a id="org149b03b"></a>

## I Samuel 20:43

And David arose, and departed: and Jonathan went into the city. 


<a id="org84fff8b"></a>

# I Samuel 21


<a id="org44146b5"></a>

## I Samuel 21:1

And David came to Nobe, to Achimelech, the priest and Achimelech was astonished at David&rsquo;s coming. And he said to him: Why art thou alone, and no man with thee?


<a id="org30e6977"></a>

## I Samuel 21:2

And David said to Achimelech, the priest: The king hath commanded me a business, and said: Let no man know the thing for which thou art sent by me, and what manner of commands I have given thee: and I have appointed my servants to such and such a place.


<a id="orgd85677b"></a>

## I Samuel 21:3

Now therefore if thou have any thing at hand, though it were but five loaves, give me, or whatsoever thou canst find.


<a id="org2cb51ff"></a>

## I Samuel 21:4

And the priest answered David, saying: I have no common bread at hand, but only holy bread, if the young men be clean, especially from women?


<a id="org57fd0a0"></a>

## I Samuel 21:5

And David answered the priest, and said to him: Truly, as to what concerneth women, we have refrained ourselves from yesterday and the day before, when we came out, and the vessels of the young men were holy. Now this way is defiled, but it shall also be sanctified this day in the vessels.


<a id="org1c47a3a"></a>

## I Samuel 21:6

The priest therefore gave him hallowed bread: for there was no bread there, but only the loaves of proposition, which had been taken away from before the face of the Lord, that hot loaves might be set up.


<a id="org48210ab"></a>

## I Samuel 21:7

Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, within the tabernacle of the Lord: and his name was Doeg, an Edomite, the chiefest of Saul&rsquo;s herdsmen.


<a id="org8e640c6"></a>

## I Samuel 21:8

And David said to Achimelech: Hast thou here at hand a spear, or a sword? for I brought not my own sword, nor my own weapons with me, for the king&rsquo;s business required haste.


<a id="org80bd90e"></a>

## I Samuel 21:9

And the priest said: Lo, here is the sword of Goliath, the Philistine, whom thou slewest in the valley of Terebinth, wrapped up in a cloth behind the ephod: if thou wilt take this, take it, for here there is no other but this. And David said: There is none like that, give it me.


<a id="org34c9edf"></a>

## I Samuel 21:10

And David arose and fled that day from the face of Saul: and came to Achis, the king of Geth:


<a id="org7dcf1fd"></a>

## I Samuel 21:11

And the servants of Achis, when they saw David, said to him: Is not this David, the king of the land? Did they not sing to him in their dances, saying: Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?


<a id="org7717c66"></a>

## I Samuel 21:12

But David laid up these words in his heart, and was exceedingly afraid at the face of Achis, the king of Geth.


<a id="org80cb251"></a>

## I Samuel 21:13

And he changed his countenance before them, and slipt down between their hands: and he stumbled against the doors of the gate, and his spittle ran down upon his beard.


<a id="org98e9413"></a>

## I Samuel 21:14

And Achis said to his servants: You saw the man was mad: why have you brought him to me?


<a id="org9343fb0"></a>

## I Samuel 21:15

Have we need of mad men, that you have brought in this fellow, to play the madman in my presence? shall this fellow come into my house? 


<a id="org6dba3f6"></a>

# I Samuel 22


<a id="org85dd03e"></a>

## I Samuel 22:1

David therefore went from thence, and fled to the cave of Odollam. And when his brethren, and all his father&rsquo;s house, had heard of it, they went down to him thither.


<a id="org448aed0"></a>

## I Samuel 22:2

And all that were in distress, and oppressed with debt, and under affliction of mind, gathered themselves unto him: and he became their prince, and there were with him about four hundred men.


<a id="orgbd2e16a"></a>

## I Samuel 22:3

And David departed from thence into Maspha of Moab: and he said to the king of Moab: Let my father and my mother tarry with you, I beseech thee, till I know what God will do for me.


<a id="orge778394"></a>

## I Samuel 22:4

And he left them under the eyes of the king of Moab, and they abode with him all the days that David was in the hold.


<a id="org6b9844e"></a>

## I Samuel 22:5

And Gad the prophet said to David: Abide not in the hold, depart, and go into the land of Juda. And David departed, and came into the forest of Haret.


<a id="orga3dca34"></a>

## I Samuel 22:6

And SauI heard that David was seen, and the men that were with him. Now whilst Saul abode in Gabaa, and was in the wood, which is by Rama, having his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him,


<a id="org89e5051"></a>

## I Samuel 22:7

He said to his servants that stood about him: Hear me now, ye sons of Jemini: will the son of Isai give every one of you fields, and vineyards, and make you all tribunes, and centurions:


<a id="org35dc745"></a>

## I Samuel 22:8

That all of you have conspired against me, and there is no one to inform me, especially when even my son hath entered into league with the son of Isai? There is not one of you that pitieth my case, nor that giveth me any information: because my son hath raised up my servant against me, plotting against me to this day.


<a id="org7c7990c"></a>

## I Samuel 22:9

And Doeg, the Edomite, who stood by, and was the chief among the servants of Saul, answering, said: I saw the son of Isai, in Nobe, with Achimelech, the son of Achitob, the priest.


<a id="orgba103bd"></a>

## I Samuel 22:10

And he consulted the Lord for him, and gave him victuals, and gave him the sword of Goliath, the Philistine.


<a id="org04eb9bd"></a>

## I Samuel 22:11

Then the king sent to call for Achimelech, the priest, the son of Achitob, and all his father&rsquo;s house, the priests that were in Nobe, and they came all of them to the king.


<a id="orgece0f74"></a>

## I Samuel 22:12

And Saul said to Achimelech: Hear, thou son of Achitob. He answered: Here I am, my lord.


<a id="orga49517b"></a>

## I Samuel 22:13

And Saul said to him: Why have you conspired against me, thou, and the son of Isai, and thou hast given him bread and a sword, and hast consulted the Lord for him, that he should rise up against me, continuing a traitor to this day.


<a id="org0b495df"></a>

## I Samuel 22:14

And Achimelech answering the king, said: And who amongst all thy servants is so faithful as David, who is the king&rsquo;s son in law, and goeth forth at thy bidding, and is honourable in thy house?


<a id="orgf72e182"></a>

## I Samuel 22:15

Did I begin to day to consult the Lord for him? far be this from me: let not the king suspect such a thing against his servant, or any one in all my father&rsquo;s house: for thy servant knew nothing of this matter, either little or great.


<a id="orgc529c81"></a>

## I Samuel 22:16

And the king said: Dying thou shalt die, Achimelech, thou and all thy father&rsquo;s house.


<a id="org211a43c"></a>

## I Samuel 22:17

And the king said to the messengers that stood about him: Turn, and kill the priests of the Lord, for their hand is with David, because they knew that he was fled, and they told it not to me. And the king&rsquo;s servants would not put forth their hands against the priests of the Lord.


<a id="org834ff73"></a>

## I Samuel 22:18

And the king said to Doeg: Turn thou, and fall upon the priests. And Doeg, the Edomite, turned, and fell upon the priests, and slew in that day eighty-five men that wore the linen ephod.


<a id="org307974a"></a>

## I Samuel 22:19

And Nobe, the city of the priests, he smote with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and ox, and ass, and sheep, with the edge of the sword.


<a id="org49fde62"></a>

## I Samuel 22:20

But one of the sons of Achimelech, the son of Achitob, whose name was Abiathar, escaped, and fled to David,


<a id="org5939c45"></a>

## I Samuel 22:21

And told him that Saul had slain the priests of the Lord.


<a id="orgbbc8618"></a>

## I Samuel 22:22

And David said to Abiathar: I knew that day when Doeg, the Edomite, was there, that without doubt he would tell Saul: I have been the occasion of the death of all the souls of thy father&rsquo;s house.


<a id="org8a3e140"></a>

## I Samuel 22:23

Abide thou with me, fear not: for he that seeketh my life, seeketh thy life also, and with me thou shalt be saved. 


<a id="org88dbb07"></a>

# I Samuel 23


<a id="org228bb68"></a>

## I Samuel 23:1

And they told David, saying: Behold the Philistines fight against Ceila, and they rob the barns.


<a id="org0f7a7f5"></a>

## I Samuel 23:2

Therefore David consulted the Lord, saying: Shall I go and smite these Philistines? And the Lord said to David: Go, and thou shalt smite the Philistines, and shalt save Ceila.


<a id="org9c5b305"></a>

## I Samuel 23:3

And the men that were with David, said to him: Behold we are in fear here in Judea, how much more if we go to Ceila against the bands of the Philistines?


<a id="orgea7f841"></a>

## I Samuel 23:4

Therefore David consulted the Lord again. And he answered and said to him: Arise, and go to Ceila: for I will deliver the Philistines into thy hand.


<a id="orge861071"></a>

## I Samuel 23:5

David, therefore, and his men, went to Ceila, and fought against the Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and made a great slaughter of them: and David saved the inhabitants of Ceila.


<a id="org460412e"></a>

## I Samuel 23:6

Now at that time, when Abiathar, the son of Achimelech, fled to David, to Ceila, he came down, having an ephod with him.


<a id="org74e2dee"></a>

## I Samuel 23:7

And it was told Saul that David was come to Ceila: and Saul said: The Lord hath delivered him into my hands, and he is shut up, being come into a city that hath gates and bars.


<a id="orgd52eec6"></a>

## I Samuel 23:8

And Saul commanded all the people to go down to fight against Ceila, and to besiege David and his men.


<a id="org8dcaba8"></a>

Now when David understood that Saul secretly prepared evil against him, he said to Abiathar, the priest: Bring hither the ephod.


<a id="orgf30851c"></a>

## I Samuel 23:10

And David said: O Lord God of Israel, thy servant hath heard a report, that Saul designeth to come to Ceila, to destroy the city for my sake:


<a id="org6bf1093"></a>

## I Samuel 23:11

Will the men of Ceila deliver me into his hands? and will Saul come down, as thy servant hath heard? O Lord God of Israel, tell thy servant. And the Lord said: He will come down.


<a id="orgfcc1bbd"></a>

## I Samuel 23:12

And David said: Will the men of Ceila deliver me and my men into the hands of Saul? And the Lord said: They will deliver thee up.


<a id="orge393625"></a>

## I Samuel 23:13

Then David and his men, who were about six hundred, arose, and departing from Ceila, wandered up and down, uncertain where they should stay: and it was told Saul that David was fled from Ceila, and had escaped: wherefore he forbore to go out.


<a id="org10adb7d"></a>

## I Samuel 23:14

But David abode in the desert in strong holds, and he remained in a mountain of the desert of Ziph, in a woody hill. And Saul sought him always: but the Lord delivered him not into his hands.


<a id="orga83bfd7"></a>

## I Samuel 23:15

And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life. And David was in the desert of Ziph, in a wood.

And Jonathan, the son of Saul, arose, and went to David, into the wood, and strengthened his hands in God: and he said to him:


<a id="orgc4f872e"></a>

## I Samuel 23:17

Fear not: for the hand of my father, Saul, shall not find thee, and thou shalt reign over Israel, and I shall be next to thee; yea and my father knoweth this.


<a id="orgb8c7abb"></a>

## I Samuel 23:19

And the Ziphites went up to Saul, in Gabaa, saying: Lo, doth not David lie hid with us in the strong holds of the wood, in mount Hachila, which is on the right hand of the desert.


<a id="org18264a8"></a>

## I Samuel 23:20

Now therefore come down, as thy soul hath desired to come down: and it shall be our business to deliver him into the king&rsquo;s hands.


<a id="org1ec6a67"></a>

## I Samuel 23:21

And Saul said: Blessed be ye of the Lord, for you have pitied my case.


<a id="org2b34e4b"></a>

## I Samuel 23:22

Go, therefore, I pray you, and use all diligence, and curiously inquire, and consider the place where his foot is, and who hath seen him there: for he thinketh of me, that I lie craftily in wait for him.


<a id="orgc75e6dc"></a>

## I Samuel 23:23

Consider, and see all his lurking holes, wherein he is hid, and return to me with the certainty of the thing, that I may go with you. And if he should even go down into the earth to hide himself, I will search him out in all the thousands of Juda.


<a id="org0f8173d"></a>

Then Saul and his men went to seek him: and it was told David, and forthwith he went down to the rock, and abode in the wilderness of Maon: and when Saul had heard of it, he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon.


<a id="orgf8ac055"></a>

## I Samuel 23:26

And Saul went on this side of the mountain: and David and his men were on the other side of the mountain: and David despaired of being able to escape from the face of Saul: and Saul and his men encompassed David and his men round about, to take them.


<a id="org2137e9e"></a>

And a messenger came to Saul, saying: Make haste to come, for the Philistines have poured in themselves upon the land.


<a id="orgc845d46"></a>

## I Samuel 24:4

## I Samuel 24:5

And the servants of David said to him: Behold the day, of which the Lord said to thee: I will deliver thy enemy unto thee, that thou mayst do to him as it shall seem good in thy eyes. Then David arose, and secretly cut off the hem of Saul&rsquo;s robe.


<a id="orgf46efcd"></a>

## I Samuel 24:6

After which David&rsquo;s heart struck him, because he had cut off the hem of Saul&rsquo;s robe.


<a id="org3eeedc1"></a>

## I Samuel 24:7

And he said to his men: The Lord be merciful unto me, that I may do no such thing to my master, the Lord&rsquo;s anointed, as to lay my hand upon him, because he is the Lord&rsquo;s anointed.

## I Samuel 24:8

And David stopped his men with his words, and suffered them not to rise against Saul: but Saul, rising up out of the cave, went on his way.


<a id="orgbdf08e0"></a>

## I Samuel 24:9

And David also rose up after him: and going out of the cave, cried after Saul, saying: My lord the king. And Saul looked behind him: and David bowing himself down to the ground, worshipped,


<a id="orgef29e70"></a>

## I Samuel 24:10

And said to Saul: Why dost thou hear the words of men that say: David seeketh thy hurt?


<a id="org7ef9c3b"></a>

## I Samuel 24:11

Behold this day thy eyes have seen, that the Lord hath delivered thee into my hand, in the cave, and I had a thought to kill thee, but my eye hath spared thee. For I said: I will not put out my hand against my lord, because he is the Lord&rsquo;s anointed.


<a id="org995feaf"></a>

## I Samuel 24:12

Moreover, see and know, O my father, the hem of thy robe in my hand, that when I cut off the hem of thy robe, I would not put out my hand against thee.

<a id="org216b71d"></a>

## I Samuel 25:1

And Samuel died, and all Israel was gathered together, and they mourned for him, and buried him in his house in Ramatha. And David rose, and went down into the wilderness of Pharan.


<a id="org9275040"></a>

## I Samuel 25:2

Now there was a certain man in the wilderness of Maon, and his possessions were in Carmel, and the man was very great: and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats: and it happened that he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.


<a id="orgc95d2b1"></a>

## I Samuel 25:3

Now the name of the man was Nabal: and the name of his wife was Abigail. And she was a prudent and very comely woman: but her husband was churlish, and very bad and ill natured: and he was of the house of Caleb.


<a id="orgdf24f6f"></a>

## I Samuel 25:4

And when David heard in the wilderness, that Nabal was shearing his sheep,


<a id="orgec118bf"></a>

## I Samuel 25:5

He sent ten young men, and said to them: Go up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and salute him in my name with peace.


<a id="orgcd73309"></a>

## I Samuel 25:6

And you shall say: Peace be to my brethren, and to thee, and peace to thy house, and peace to all that thou hast.


<a id="orga1f869f"></a>

## I Samuel 25:7

I have heard that thy shepherds that were with us in the desert were shearing: we never molested them, neither was there ought missing to them of the flock at any time, all the while they were with us in Carmel.


<a id="org576be3e"></a>

## I Samuel 25:8

Ask thy servants, and they will tell thee. Now therefore let thy servants find favour in thy eyes: for we are come in a good day, whatsoever thy hand shall find give to thy servants, and to thy son David.


<a id="org7c382ed"></a>

## I Samuel 25:9

And when David&rsquo;s servants came, they spoke to Nabal all these words in David&rsquo;s name, and then held their peace.


<a id="org1e110e4"></a>

## I Samuel 25:10

But Nabal answering the servants of David, said: Who is David? and what is the son of Isai? servants are multiplied now days who flee from their masters.


<a id="org0b44736"></a>

## I Samuel 25:11

Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and the flesh of my cattle, which I have killed for my shearers, and give to men whom I know not whence they are?


<a id="org3df010b"></a>

## I Samuel 25:12

So the servants of David went back their way, and returning came and told him all the words that he said.


<a id="orga62d274"></a>

## I Samuel 25:13

Then David said to his young men: Let every man gird on his sword. And they girded on every man his sword. And David also girded on his sword: and there followed David about four hundred men, and two hundred remained with the baggage.


<a id="org4cbb803"></a>

## I Samuel 25:14

But one of the servants told, Abigail, the wife of Nabal, saying: Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness, to salute our master: and he rejected them.


<a id="org365327a"></a>

## I Samuel 25:15

These men were very good to us, and gave us no trouble: Neither did we ever lose any thing all the time that we conversed with them in the desert.


<a id="orgc00824c"></a>

## I Samuel 25:16

They were a wall unto us, both by night and day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep.


<a id="orgc129e54"></a>

## I Samuel 25:17

Wherefore consider, and think what thou hast to do: for evil is determined against thy husband, and against thy house, and he is a son of Belial, so that no man can speak to him.


<a id="org7249c7a"></a>

## I Samuel 25:18

Then Abigail made haste and took two hundred loaves, and two vessels of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched corn, and a hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of dry figs, and laid them upon asses:


<a id="orga438f78"></a>

## I Samuel 25:19

And she said to her servants: Go before me: behold, I will follow after you: but she told not her husband, Nabal.


<a id="org2ba2bf5"></a>

## I Samuel 25:20

And when she had gotten upon an ass, and was coming down to the foot of the mountain, David and his men came down over against her, and she met them.


<a id="org275167f"></a>

## I Samuel 25:21

And David said: Truly in vain have I kept all that belonged to this fellow in the wilderness, and nothing was lost of all that pertained unto him: and he hath returned me evil for good.


<a id="orgc66c6c1"></a>

## I Samuel 25:22

May God do so and so, and add more to the foes of David, if I leave of all that belong to him till the morning, any that pisseth against the wall.


<a id="org1219e35"></a>

## I Samuel 25:23

And when Abigail saw David, she made haste and lighted off the ass, and fell before David, on her face, and adored upon the ground.


<a id="org9fd171a"></a>

## I Samuel 25:24

And she fell at his feet, and said: Upon me let this iniquity be, my lord: let thy handmaid speak, I beseech thee, in thy ears, and hear the words of thy servant.


<a id="org3dca159"></a>

## I Samuel 25:25

Let not my lord the king, I pray thee, regard this naughty man, Nabal: for according to his name, he is a fool, and folly is with him: but I, thy handmaid, did not see thy servants, my lord, whom thou sentest.


<a id="orgb23a0ba"></a>

## I Samuel 25:26

Now therefore, my lord, the Lord liveth, and thy soul liveth, who hath withholden thee from coming to blood, and hath saved thy hand to thee: and now let thy enemies be as Nabal, and all they that seek evil to my lord.


<a id="org98faef6"></a>

## I Samuel 25:27

Wherefore receive this blessing, which thy handmaid hath brought to thee, my lord: and give it to the young men that follow thee, my lord.


<a id="orgf444dfe"></a>

## I Samuel 25:28

Forgive the iniquity of thy handmaid: for the Lord will surely make for my lord a faithful house, because thou, my lord, fightest the battles of the Lord: let not evil therefore be found in thee all the days of thy life.


<a id="org7945b19"></a>

## I Samuel 25:29

For if a man at any time shall rise, and persecute thee, and seek thy life, the soul of my lord shall be kept, as in the bundle of the living, with the Lord thy God: but the souls of thy enemies shall be whirled, as with the violence and whirling of a sling.


<a id="org8e67822"></a>

## I Samuel 25:30

And when the Lord shall have done to thee, my lord, all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee, and shall have made thee prince over Israel,


<a id="org9a1c199"></a>

## I Samuel 25:31

This shall not be an occasion of grief to thee, and a scruple of heart to my lord, that thou hast shed innocent blood, or hast revenged thyself: and when the Lord shall have done well by my lord, thou shalt remember thy handmaid.


<a id="orgeb58a70"></a>

## I Samuel 25:32

And David said to Abigail: Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel, who sent thee this day to meet me, and blessed be thy speech:


<a id="org9c78548"></a>

## I Samuel 25:33

And blessed be thou, who hast kept me to day from coming to blood, and revenging me with my own hand.


<a id="org5fdfd51"></a>

## I Samuel 25:34

Otherwise, as the Lord liveth, the God of Israel, who hath withholden me from doing thee any evil, if thou hadst not quickly come to meet me, there had not been left to Nabal by the morning light, any that pisseth against the wall.


<a id="orgce97d2a"></a>

## I Samuel 25:35

And David received at her hand all that she had brought him, and said to her: Go in peace into thy house, behold I have heard thy voice, and honoured thy face.


<a id="org3089186"></a>

## I Samuel 25:36

And Abigail came to Nabal: and behold he had a feast in his house, like the feast of a king: and Nabal&rsquo;s heart was merry, for he was very drunk: and she told him nothing less or more until morning.


<a id="orgeae8da6"></a>

## I Samuel 25:37

But early in the morning, when Nabal had digested his wine, his wife told him these words, and his heart died within him, and he became as a stone.


<a id="orgd8b85cb"></a>

## I Samuel 25:38

And after ten days had passed, the Lord struck Nabal, and he died.


<a id="orga22845b"></a>

## I Samuel 25:39

And when David had heard that Nabal was dead, he said: Blessed be the Lord, who hath judged the cause of my reproach, at the hand of Nabal, and hath kept his servant from evil, and the Lord hath returned the wickedness of Nabal upon his head. Then David sent and treated with Abigail, that he might take her to himself for a wife.


<a id="orga7f0025"></a>

## I Samuel 25:40

And David&rsquo;s servants came to Abigail, to Carmel, and spoke to her, saying: David hath sent us to thee, to take thee to himself for a wife.


<a id="org673d113"></a>

## I Samuel 25:41

And she arose, and bowed herself down with her face to the earth, and said: Behold, let thy servant be a handmaid, to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.


<a id="org22f8a93"></a>

## I Samuel 25:42

And Abigail arose, and made haste, and got upon an ass, and five damsels went with her, her waiting maids, and she followed the messengers of David, and became his wife.


<a id="org6574642"></a>

## I Samuel 25:43

Moreover David took also Achinoam of Jezrahel: and they were both of them his wives.


<a id="org8ee5ba7"></a>

And Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph having with him three thousand chosen men of Israel, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.


<a id="org802c283"></a>

## I Samuel 26:3

And Saul encamped in Gabaa Hachila, which was over against the wilderness in the way: and David abode in the wilderness. And seeing that Saul was come after him into the wilderness,


<a id="orge0ab223"></a>

## I Samuel 26:4

He sent spies, and learned that he was most certainly come thither.


<a id="org5fcb2c4"></a>

## I Samuel 26:5

And David arose secretly, and came to the place where Saul was: and when he had beheld the place, wherein Saul slept, and Abner, the son of Ner, the captain of his army, and Saul sleeping in a tent, and the rest of the multitude round about him,


<a id="org3c0e6be"></a>

## I Samuel 26:6

David spoke to Achimelech, the Hethite, and Abisai, the son of Sarvia, the brother of Joab, saying: Who will go down with me to Saul into the camp? And Abisai said: I will go with thee.


<a id="org74ccef5"></a>

## I Samuel 26:7

So David and Abisai came to the people by night, and found Saul lying and sleeping in the tent, and his spear fixed in the ground at his head: and Abner and the people sleeping round about him.


<a id="orgbe7f498"></a>

## I Samuel 26:8

And Abisai said to David: God hath shut up thy enemy this day into thy hands: now then I will run him through with my spear, even to the earth at once, and there shall be no need of a second time.


<a id="org73dcd7d"></a>

## I Samuel 26:9

And David said to Abisai: Kill him not: for who shall put forth his hand against the Lord&rsquo;s anointed, and shall be guiltless?


<a id="org588e188"></a>

## I Samuel 26:10

And David said: As the Lord liveth, unless the Lord shall strike him, or his day shall come to die, or he shall go down to battle, and perish:


<a id="org5cd8c7b"></a>

## I Samuel 26:11

The Lord be merciful unto me, and keep me that I never put forth my hand against the Lord&rsquo;s anointed. But now take the spear which is at his head, and the cup of water, and let us go.


<a id="org8e06ccd"></a>

## I Samuel 26:12

So David took the spear, and the cup of water which was at Saul&rsquo;s head, and they went away: and no man saw it, or knew it, or awaked, but they were all asleep, for a deep sleep from the Lord was fallen upon them.


<a id="orgf1cf4f3"></a>

## I Samuel 26:13

And when David was gone over to the other side, and stood on the top of the hill afar off, and a good space was between them,


<a id="org5d15599"></a>

## I Samuel 26:14

David cried to the people, and to Abner, the son of Ner, saying: Wilt thou not answer, Abner? And Abner answering, said: Who art thou, that criest, and disturbest the king?


<a id="org539bfc9"></a>

## I Samuel 26:15

And David said to Abner: Art not thou a man? and who is like unto thee in Israel? why then hast thou not kept thy lord the king? for there came one of the people in to kill the king thy lord.


<a id="org1dab550"></a>

## I Samuel 26:16

This thing is not good, that thou hast done: as the Lord liveth, you are the sons of death, who have not kept your master, the Lord&rsquo;s anointed. And now where is the king&rsquo;s spear, and the cup of water, which was at his head?


<a id="org7b38f9c"></a>

## I Samuel 26:17

And Saul knew David&rsquo;s voice, and said: Is this thy voice, my son David? And David said: It is my voice, my lord the king.


<a id="orgc7ce97c"></a>

And he said: Wherefore doth my lord persecute his servant? What have I done? or what evil is there in my hand?


<a id="org494e040"></a>

## I Samuel 26:19

Now therefore hear, I pray thee, my lord the king, the words of thy servant: If the Lord stir thee up against me, let him accept of sacrifice: but if the sons of men, they are cursed in the sight of the Lord, who have cast me out this day, that I should not dwell in the inheritance of the Lord, saying: Go, serve strange gods.


<a id="orgb8facc1"></a>

## I Samuel 26:20

And now let not my blood be shed upon the earth before the Lord: for the king of Israel is come out to seek a flea, as the partridge is hunted in the mountains.


<a id="orgd7bf00f"></a>

## I Samuel 26:21

And Saul said: I have sinned; return, my son David, for I will no more do thee harm, because my life hath been precious in thy eyes this day: for it appeareth that I have done foolishly, and have been ignorant in very many things.


<a id="org52f72c1"></a>

## I Samuel 26:22

And David answering, said: Behold the king&rsquo;s spear: let one of the king&rsquo;s servants come over and fetch it.


<a id="org8a3c101"></a>

## I Samuel 26:23

And the Lord will reward every one according to his justice, and his faithfulness: for the Lord hath delivered thee this day into my hand, and I would not put forth my hand against the Lord&rsquo;s anointed.


<a id="orga6ab809"></a>

## I Samuel 26:24

And as thy life hath been much set by this day in my eyes, so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the Lord, and let him deliver me from all distress.


<a id="orgd32290b"></a>

## I Samuel 26:25

Then Saul said to David: Blessed art thou, my son David: and truly doing thou shalt do, and prevailing thou shalt prevail. And David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place.

# I Samuel 27


<a id="org76e0a1e"></a>

## I Samuel 27:1

And David said in his heart: I shall one day or other fall into the hands of Saul: is it not better for me to flee, and to be saved in the land of the Philistines, that Saul may despair of me, and cease to seek me in all the coasts of Israel? I will flee then out of his hands.


<a id="org3e2a9a4"></a>

And it was told Saul that David was fled to Geth, and he sought no more after him.

## I Samuel 27:5

<a id="org027fba7"></a>

## I Samuel 27:9

## I Samuel 28:15

And Samuel said to Saul: Why hast thou disturbed my rest, that I should be brought up? And Saul said: I am in great distress: for the Philistines fight against me, and God is departed from me, and would not hear me, neither by the hand of prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called thee, that thou mayst shew me what I shall do.

<a id="orgce88ccf"></a>

## I Samuel 29:4

But the prices of the Philistines were angry with him, and they said to him: Let this man return, and abide in his place, which thou hast appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest he be an adversary to us, when we shall begin to fight: for how can he otherwise appease his master, but with our heads?
