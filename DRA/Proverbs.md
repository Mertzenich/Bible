He shall understand a parable and the interpretation, the words of the wise, and their mysterious sayings.

## Proverbs 1:15

My son, walk not thou with them, restrain thy foot from their paths.


<a id="orga8aeca2"></a>

## Proverbs 1:16

For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.


<a id="org654f3e6"></a>

## Proverbs 1:17

But a net is spread in vain before the eyes of them that have wings.

<a id="orgeb8895a"></a>

## Proverbs 1:21

At the head of multitudes she crieth out, in the entrance of the gates of the city she uttereth her words, saying:


<a id="org2f837eb"></a>

## Proverbs 1:22

O children, how long will you love childishness, and fools covet those things which are hurtful to themselves, and the unwise hate knowledge?


<a id="org58eda0d"></a>

## Proverbs 1:23

Turn ye at my reproof: behold I will utter my spirit to you, and will shew you my words.


<a id="orgf733cdf"></a>

Because I called, and you refused: I stretched out my hand, and there was none that regarded.


<a id="orga44a226"></a>

You have despised all my counsel, and have neglected my reprehensions.


<a id="orged5464e"></a>

## Proverbs 1:26

I also will laugh in your destruction, and will mock when that shall come to you which you feared.


<a id="orgb16779c"></a>

## Proverbs 1:27

When sudden calamity shall fall on you, and destruction, as a tempest, shall be at hand: when tribulation and distress shall come upon you:


<a id="org1e5db23"></a>

## Proverbs 1:28

Then shall they call upon me, and I will not hear: they shall rise in the morning, and shall not find me:


<a id="orga1124a1"></a>
