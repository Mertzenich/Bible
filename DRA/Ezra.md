## Ezra 4:3

But Zorobabel, and Josue, and the rest of the chief of the fathers of Israel said to them: You have nothing to do with us to build a house to our God, but we ourselves alone will build to the Lord our God, as Cyrus king of the Persians hath commanded us.

## Ezra 4:11

(This is the copy of the letter, which they sent to him:) To Artaxerxes the king, thy servants, the men that are on this side of the river, send greeting.

## Ezra 4:12

Be it known to the king, that the Jews, who came up from thee to us, are come to Jerusalem a rebellious and wicked city, which they are building, setting up the ramparts thereof and repairing the walls.


<a id="org87e7a95"></a>

## Ezra 4:13

And now be it known to the king, that if this city be built up, and the walls thereof repaired, they will not pay tribute nor toll, nor yearly revenues, and this loss will fall upon the kings.


<a id="orgabfdb9f"></a>

## Ezra 4:14

But we remembering the salt that we have eaten in the palace, and because we count it a crime to see the king wronged, have therefore sent and certified the king,


<a id="orge98138f"></a>

## Ezra 4:15

That search may be made in the books of the histories of thy fathers, and thou shalt find written in the records: and shalt know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful to the kings and provinces, and that wars were raised therein of old time: for which cause also the city was destroyed.


<a id="org540f8c4"></a>

The accusation, which you have sent to us, hath been plainly read before me,


<a id="org03402a8"></a>

## Ezra 4:19

And I commanded: and search hath been made, and it is found, that this city of old time hath rebelled against kings, and seditions and wars have been raised therein.


<a id="org57eb30a"></a>

## Ezra 4:20

For there have been powerful kings in Jerusalem, who have had dominion over all the country that is beyond the river: and have received tribute, and toll and revenues.


<a id="org5bda1f1"></a>

## Ezra 4:21

Now therefore hear the sentence: Hinder those men, that this city be not built, till further orders be given by me.


<a id="org353a007"></a>

And at the same time came to them Thathanai, who was governor beyond the river, and Stharbuzanai, and their counsellors: and said thus to them: Who hath given you counsel to build this house, and to repair the walls thereof?

## Ezra 5:4

In answer to which we gave them the names of the men who were the promoters of that building.


<a id="org8ca34ef"></a>

## Ezra 5:5

## Ezra 5:8

Be it known to the king, that we went to the province of Judea, to the house of the great God, which they are building with unpolished stones, and timber is laid in the walls: and this work is carried on diligently and advanceth in their hands.


<a id="org44776a3"></a>

## Ezra 5:9

And we asked those ancients, and said to them thus: Who hath given you authority to build this house, and to repair these walls?


<a id="orgcade516"></a>

## Ezra 5:10

We asked also of them their names, that we might give thee notice: and we have written the names of the men that are the chief among them.


<a id="orgd1adf62"></a>

## Ezra 5:11

And they answered us in these words, saying: We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and we are building a temple that was built these many years ago, and which a great king of Israel built and set up.


<a id="org9c1a372"></a>

## Ezra 5:12

But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven to wrath, he delivered them into the hands of Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon the Chaldean: and he destroyed this house, and carried away the people to Babylon.

<a id="orgf8e9e14"></a>

And said to him: Take these vessels, and go, and put them in the temple that is in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be built in its place.


<a id="orge2f82d3"></a>

## Ezra 5:16

Then came this same Sassabasar, and laid the foundations of the temple of God in Jerusalem, and from that time until now it is in building, and is not yet finished.


<a id="orgee8c2e7"></a>

## Ezra 5:17

Now therefore if it seem good to the king, let him search in the king&rsquo;s library, which is in Babylon, whether it hath been decreed by Cyrus the king, that the house of God in Jerusalem should be built, and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter. 


<a id="orgcf2e4f4"></a>

And also let the golden and silver vessels of the temple of God, which Nabuchodonosor took out of the temple of Jerusalem, and brought to Babylon, be restored, and carried back to the temple of Jerusalem to their place, which also were placed in the temple of God.


<a id="org54d23b5"></a>

## Ezra 6:6

Now therefore Thathanai, governor of the country beyond the river, Stharbuzanai, and your counsellors the Apharsachites, who are beyond the river, depart far from them,


<a id="org300e33a"></a>

## Ezra 6:7

And let that temple of God be built by the governor of the Jews, and by their ancients, that they may build that house of God in its place.


<a id="org4507b97"></a>

I also have commanded what must be done by those ancients of the Jews, that the house of God may be built, to wit, that of the king&rsquo;s chest, that is, of the tribute that is paid out of the country beyond the river, the charges be diligently given to those men, lest the work be hindered.

<a id="org314a1d4"></a>

## Ezra 9:2

## Ezra 9:7

From the days of our fathers: and we ourselves also have sinned grievously unto this day, and for our iniquities we and our kings, and our priests have been delivered into the hands of the kings of the lands, and to the sword, and to captivity, and to spoil, and to confusion of face, as it is at this day.


<a id="org03c3b1a"></a>

## Ezra 9:8

And now as a little, and for a moment has our prayer been made before the Lord our God, to leave us a remnant, and give us a pin in his holy place, and that our God would enlighten our eyes, and would give us a little life in our bondage.


<a id="org48b6c80"></a>

## Ezra 9:9

For we are bondmen, and in our bondage our God hath not forsaken us, but hath extended mercy upon us before the king of the Persians, to give us life, and to set up the house of our God, and to rebuild the desolations thereof, and to give us a fence in Juda and Jerusalem.


<a id="org99c4783"></a>

Which thou hast commanded by the hand of thy servants the prophets, saying: The land which you go to possess, is an unclean land, according to the uncleanness of the people, and of other lands, with their abominations, who have filled it from mouth to mouth with their filth.


<a id="orgba0369e"></a>

## Ezra 9:12

Now therefore give not your daughters to their sons, and take not their daughters for your sons, and seek not their peace, nor their prosperity for ever: that you may be strengthened, and may eat the good things of the land, and may have your children your heirs for ever.


<a id="orgebcdc85"></a>

## Ezra 9:13

And after all that is come upon us, for our most wicked deeds, and our great sin, seeing that thou our God hast saved us from our iniquity, and hast given us a deliverance as at this day,


<a id="orgf947a09"></a>

## Ezra 9:14

That we should not turn away, nor break thy commandments, nor join in marriage with the people of these abominations. Art thou angry with us unto utter destruction, not to leave us a remnant to be saved?


<a id="org8e3e1a8"></a>

## Ezra 9:15

O Lord God of Israel, thou art just: for we remain yet to be saved as at this day. Behold we are before thee in our sin, for there can be no standing before thee in this matter.

## Ezra 10:2

And Sechenias the son of Jehiel of the sons of Elam answered, and said to Esdras: We have sinned against our God, and have taken strange wives of the people of the land: and now if there be repentance in Israel concerning this,

## Ezra 10:3

Let us make a covenant with the Lord our God, to put away all the wives, and such as are born of them, according to the will of the Lord, and of them that fear the commandment of the Lord our God: let it be done according to the law.

## Ezra 10:14

Let rulers be appointed in all the multitude: and in all our cities, let them that have taken strange wives come at the times appointed, and with them the ancients and the judges of every city, until the wrath of our God be turned away from us for this sin.
