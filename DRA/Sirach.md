# Sirach 3

The sons of wisdom are the church of the just: and their generation, obedience and love.

## Sirach 3:2

Children, hear the judgment of your father, and so do that you may be saved.


<a id="orgc9b95a1"></a>

<a id="org36c17aa"></a>

<a id="orgc5d378a"></a>

## Sirach 3:8

He that feareth the Lord, honoureth his parents, and will serve them as his masters that brought him into the world.


<a id="org93d3c75"></a>

## Sirach 3:9

Honour thy father, in work and word, and all patience,


<a id="org1b6886f"></a>

## Sirach 3:10

That a blessing may come upon thee from him, and his blessing may remain in the latter end.


<a id="org440bbbc"></a>

## Sirach 3:11

The father&rsquo;s blessing establisheth the houses of the children: but the mother&rsquo;s curse rooteth up the foundation.


<a id="org8c8236d"></a>

## Sirach 3:12

Glory not in the dishonour of thy father: for his shame is no glory to thee.


<a id="org78bf6f1"></a>

## Sirach 3:13

For the glory of a man is from the honour of his father, and a father without honour is the disgrace of the son.


<a id="org07a896a"></a>

## Sirach 3:14

Son, support the old age of thy father, and grieve him not in his life;


<a id="org6b0cc99"></a>

And if his understanding fail, have patience with him, and despise him not when thou art in thy strength: for the relieving of the father shall not be forgotten.

## Sirach 3:16

For good shall be repaid to thee for the sin of thy mother.


<a id="org20738df"></a>

## Sirach 3:17

And in justice thou shalt be built up, and in the day of affliction thou shalt be remembered: and thy sins shall melt away as the ice in the fair warm weather.


<a id="orgc3a2785"></a>

## Sirach 3:18

Of what an evil fame is he that forsaketh his father: and he is cursed of God that angereth his mother.


<a id="orgb770ae9"></a>

## Sirach 3:19

My son, do thy works in meekness, and thou shalt be beloved above the glory of men.


<a id="org07bbe15"></a>

## Sirach 3:20

The greater thou art, the more humble thyself in all things, and thou shalt find grace before God:


<a id="org4295f1e"></a>

## Sirach 3:21

For great is the power of God alone, and he is honoured by the humble.


<a id="org5d9e7ba"></a>

## Sirach 3:22

Seek not the things that are too high for thee, and search not into things above thy ability: but the things that God hath commanded thee, think on them always, and in many of his works be not curious.


<a id="org5ee569b"></a>

## Sirach 3:23

For it is not necessary for thee to see with thy eyes those things that are hid.


<a id="org8118d8a"></a>

## Sirach 3:24

In unnecessary matters be not over curious, and in many of his works thou shalt not be inquisitive.


<a id="org7a98afa"></a>

## Sirach 3:25

For many things are shewn to thee above the understanding of men.


<a id="orgcfdd738"></a>

## Sirach 3:26

And the suspicion of them hath deceived many, and hath detained their minds in vanity.


<a id="org1ddf70f"></a>

## Sirach 3:27

A hard heart shall fear evil at the last: and he that loveth danger shall perish in it.


<a id="org6043f1c"></a>

## Sirach 3:28

A heart that goeth two ways shall not have success, and the perverse of heart shall be scandalized therein.


<a id="org394579f"></a>

## Sirach 3:29

A wicked heart shall be laden with sorrows, and the sinner will add sin to sin.


<a id="org3621ca3"></a>

## Sirach 3:30

The congregation of the proud shall not be healed: for the plant of wickedness shall take root in them, and it shall not be perceived.


<a id="org30a9eb4"></a>

## Sirach 3:31

The heart of the wise is understood in wisdom, and a good ear will hear wisdom with all desire.


<a id="org3ec131f"></a>

## Sirach 3:32

A wise heart, and which hath understanding, will abstain from sins, and in the works of justice shall have success.


<a id="orgc77d469"></a>

## Sirach 3:33

Water quencheth a flaming fire, and alms resisteth sins:


<a id="orgfbe0117"></a>

## Sirach 3:34

And God provideth for him that sheweth favour: he remembereth him afterwards, and in the time of his fall he shall find a sure stay. 


<a id="org98b79db"></a>

# Sirach 4

## Sirach 4:1

Son, defraud not the poor of alms, and turn not away thy eyes from the poor.

Despise not the hungry soul: and provoke not the poor in his want.


<a id="org3590de5"></a>

## Sirach 4:3

Afflict not the heart of the needy, and defer not to gibe to him that is in distress.


<a id="org702b611"></a>

## Sirach 4:4

Reject not the petition of the afflicted: and turn not away thy face from the needy.


<a id="org7308b1a"></a>

## Sirach 4:5

## Sirach 23:28

And he knoweth not that the eyes of the Lord are far brighter than the sun, beholding round about all the ways of men, and the bottom of the deep, and looking into the hearts of men, into the most hidden parts.

They that explain me shall have life everlasting.

## Sirach 24:40

I, wisdom, have poured out rivers.


<a id="org174276d"></a>

With three things my spirit is pleased, which are approved before God and men:

The concord of brethren, and the love of neighbours, and man and wife that agree well together.


<a id="orgf93b514"></a>

## Sirach 25:3

Three sorts my soul hateth, and I am greatly grieved at their life:


<a id="org1af3723"></a>

A poor man that is proud: a rich man that is a liar: an old man that is a fool, and doting.


<a id="org58120f8"></a>

## Sirach 25:5

The things that thou hast not gathered in thy youth, how shalt thou find them in thy old age?


<a id="org78bf678"></a>

## Sirach 25:6

O how comely is judgment for a grey head, and for ancients to know counsel!


<a id="orgbed08ba"></a>

## Sirach 25:14

The fear of God hath set itself above all things:


<a id="org759d918"></a>

## Sirach 25:15

And a man will choose any plague, but the plague of the heart:

## Sirach 25:22

There is no head worse than the head of a serpent:


<a id="org33ce1a4"></a>

And there is no anger above the anger of a woman. It will be more agreeable to abide with a lion and a dragon, than to dwell with a wicked woman.


<a id="org867dd58"></a>

## Sirach 25:24

The wickedness of a woman changeth her face: and she darkeneth her countenance as a bear: and sheweth it like sackcloth. In the midst of her neighbours,

Her husband groaned, and hearing he sighed a little.


<a id="org55f27f4"></a>

<a id="org98b7524"></a>

## Sirach 25:31

A wicked woman abateth the courage, and maketh a heavy countenance, and a wounded heart.

From the woman came the beginning of sin, and by her we all die.


<a id="org36c1b97"></a>

## Sirach 26:5

Of three things my heart hath been afraid, and at the fourth my face hath trembled:


<a id="org7f92f52"></a>

## Sirach 26:6

The accusation of a city, and the gathering together of the people:


<a id="org17044cc"></a>

## Sirach 26:7

And a false calumny, all are more grievous than death.


<a id="org9b79711"></a>

## Sirach 26:8

A jealous woman is the grief and mourning of the heart.

<a id="org6529274"></a>

## Sirach 26:15

She will open her mouth as a thirsty traveller to the fountain, and will drink of every water near her, and will sit down by every hedge, and open her quiver against every arrow, until she fail.

## Sirach 26:26

A man of war fainting through poverty, and a man of sense despised:

## Sirach 26:27

And he that passeth over from justice to sin, God hath prepared such an one for the sword.


<a id="org7b6915f"></a>

## Sirach 26:28

Two sorts of callings have appeared to me hard and dangerous: a merchant is hardly free from negligence: and a huckster shall not be justified from the sins of the lips.

In the quarrels of the road is the shedding of blood: and their cursing is a grievous hearing.

## Sirach 33:28

Torture and fetters are for a malicious slave: send him to work, that he be not idle:


<a id="org65bd3b6"></a>

## Sirach 33:29

For idleness hath taught much evil.


<a id="org459c3d4"></a>

## Sirach 33:30

Set him to work: for so it is fit for him. And if he be not obedient, bring him down with fetters, but be not excessive towards any one, and do no grievous thing without judgment.

## Sirach 33:31

If thou have a faithful servant, let him be to thee as thy own soul: treat him as a brother: because in the blood of thy soul thou hast gotten him.

## Sirach 34:1

The hopes of a man that is void of understanding are vain and deceitful: and dreams lift up fools.


<a id="org31780db"></a>

## Sirach 34:2

The man that giveth heed to lying visions, is like to him that catcheth at a shadow, and followeth after the wind.


<a id="orga6e2117"></a>

## Sirach 34:3

The vision of dreams is the resemblance of one thing to another: as when a man&rsquo;s likeness is before the face of a man.


<a id="orgc1b6e29"></a>

## Sirach 34:4

What can be made clean by the unclean? and what truth can come from that which is false?


<a id="orgf2d98f5"></a>

## Sirach 34:5

Deceitful divinations and lying omens and the dreams of evildoers, are vanity:


<a id="org1a5b59f"></a>

## Sirach 34:6

And the heart fancieth as that of a woman in travail: except it be a vision sent forth from the most High, set not thy heart upon them.


<a id="org04fe3d6"></a>

For dreams have deceived many, and they have failed that put their trust in them.

<a id="orgdf14a97"></a>

## Sirach 34:10

He that hath no experience, knoweth little: and he that hath been experienced in many things, multiplieth prudence.


<a id="org472bfdb"></a>

## Sirach 34:11

He that hath not been tried, what manner of things doth he know? he that hath been surprised, shall abound with subtlety.

## Sirach 34:12

I have seen many things by travelling, and many customs of things.


<a id="org15e5741"></a>

## Sirach 34:13

Sometimes I have been in danger of death for these things, and I have been delivered by the grace of God.

To whom doth he look, and who is his strength?


<a id="org687dba6"></a>

## Sirach 34:19

The eyes of the Lord are upon them that fear him, he is their powerful protector, and strong stay, a defence from the heat, and a cover from the sun at noon,


<a id="org09290e3"></a>

## Sirach 34:20

A preservation from stumbling, and a help from falling: he raiseth up the soul, and enlighteneth the eyes, and giveth health, and life, and blessing.


<a id="orgb2ec3f8"></a>

## Sirach 34:21

The offering of him that sacrificeth of a thing wrongfully gotten, is stained, and the mockeries of the unjust are not acceptable.


<a id="org928629a"></a>

## Sirach 34:22

The Lord is only for them that wait upon him in the way of truth and justice.


<a id="orgce52b34"></a>

## Sirach 34:23

The most High approveth not the gifts of the wicked: neither hath he respect to the oblations of the unjust, nor will he be pacified for sins by the multitude of their sacrifices.


<a id="org8be353f"></a>

## Sirach 34:24

He that offereth sacrifice of the goods of the poor, is as one that sacrificeth the son in the presence of his father.


<a id="orgbec5ed2"></a>

## Sirach 34:25

The bread of the needy, is the life of the poor: he that defraudeth them thereof, is a man of blood.


<a id="org3585991"></a>

## Sirach 34:26

He that taketh away the bread gotten by sweat, is like him that killeth his neighbour.


<a id="orga5458bc"></a>

## Sirach 34:27

He that sheddeth blood, and he that defraudeth the laborer of his hire, are brothers.


<a id="orgeb63b8a"></a>

## Sirach 34:28

When one buildeth up, and another pulleth down: what profit have they but the labour?


<a id="org5c9a1bf"></a>

## Sirach 34:29

When one prayeth, and another curseth: whose voice will God hear?


<a id="orgb2d4020"></a>

## Sirach 34:30

He that washeth himself after touching the dead, if he toucheth him again, what doth his washing avail?


<a id="orga1c1f43"></a>

## Sirach 34:31

So a man that fasteth for his sins, and doth the same again, what doth his humbling himself profit him? who will hear his prayer? 


<a id="org927e540"></a>

# Sirach 35


<a id="org8e7988d"></a>

## Sirach 35:1

He that keepeth the law, multiplieth offerings.


<a id="org68d5635"></a>

## Sirach 35:2

It is a wholesome sacrifice to take heed to the commandments, and to depart from all iniquity.


<a id="org5936c9a"></a>

## Sirach 35:3

And to depart from injustice, is to offer a propitiatory sacrifice for injustices, and a begging of pardon for sins.


<a id="orgc8a80ee"></a>

## Sirach 35:4

He shall return thanks, that offereth fine flour: and he that doth mercy, offereth sacrifice.


<a id="org20cff3d"></a>

## Sirach 35:5

To depart from iniquity is that which pleaseth the Lord, and to depart from injustice, is an entreaty for sins.


<a id="org23156fc"></a>

## Sirach 35:6

Thou shalt not appear empty in the sight of the Lord.


<a id="org265edec"></a>

## Sirach 35:7

For all these things are to be done because of the commandment of God.


<a id="org1af5694"></a>

## Sirach 35:8

The oblation of the just maketh the altar fat, and is an odour of sweetness in the sight of the most High.

The sacrifice of the just is acceptable, and the Lord will not forget the memorial thereof.


<a id="org5ba4f06"></a>

For the Lord maketh recompense, and will give thee seven times as much.

## Sirach 35:14

Do not offer wicked gifts, for such he will not receive.


<a id="orgf8ab020"></a>

## Sirach 35:16

The Lord will not accept any person against a poor man, and he will hear the prayer of him that is wronged.


<a id="org21bdeb5"></a>

## Sirach 35:17

He will not despise the prayers of the fatherless: nor the widow, when she poureth out her complaint.


<a id="orga4188e8"></a>

## Sirach 35:18

Do not the widow&rsquo;s tears run down the cheek, and her cry against him that causeth them to fall?


<a id="orgfad2858"></a>

## Sirach 35:19

For from the cheek they go up even to heaven, and the Lord that heareth will not be delighted with them.


<a id="org439d08b"></a>

## Sirach 35:20

He that adoreth God with joy, shall be accepted, and his prayer shall approach even to the clouds.


<a id="orgcdaf9eb"></a>

## Sirach 35:21

The prayer of him that humbleth himself, shall pierce the clouds: and till it come nigh he will not be comforted: and he will not depart till the most High behold.


<a id="org35100a1"></a>

## Sirach 35:22

And the Lord will not be slack, but will judge for the just, and will do judgment: and the Almighty will not have patience with them, that he may crush their back:

And he will repay vengeance to the Gentiles, till he have taken away the multitude of the proud, and broken the sceptres of the unjust,

Till he have rendered to men according to their deeds: and according to the works of Adam, and according to his presumption,

Till he have judged the cause of his people, and he shall delight the just with his mercy.

## Sirach 51:29

My entrails were troubled in seeking her: therefore shall I possess a good possession.


<a id="org153e5a7"></a>

## Sirach 51:30

The Lord hath given me a tongue for my reward: and with it I will praise him.
