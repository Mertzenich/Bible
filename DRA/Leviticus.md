# Leviticus 1


<a id="org23c2c88"></a>

## Leviticus 1:1

And the Lord called Moses, and spoke to him from the tabernacle of the testimony, saying:


<a id="org6e893e5"></a>

## Leviticus 1:2

Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them: The man among you that shall offer to the Lord a sacrifice of the cattle, that is, offering victims of oxen and sheep:


<a id="org298fe19"></a>

## Leviticus 1:3

If his offering be a holocaust, and of the herd, he shall offer a male without blemish, at the door of the testimony, to make the Lord favourable to him.


<a id="orgd63fc94"></a>

## Leviticus 1:4

And he shall put his hand upon the head of the victim: and it shall be acceptable, and help to its expiation.


<a id="org5fb3a43"></a>

## Leviticus 1:5

And he shall immolate the calf before the Lord: and the priests the sons of Aaron shall offer the blood thereof, pouring it round about the altar, which is before the door of the tabernacle.


<a id="org5b1e437"></a>

## Leviticus 1:6

And when they have flayed the victim, they shall cut the joints into pieces:


<a id="orgea2a580"></a>

## Leviticus 1:7

And shall put fire on the altar, having before laid in order a pile of wood.


<a id="org86606f6"></a>

## Leviticus 1:8

And they shall lay the parts that are cut out in order thereupon: to wit, the head, and all things that cleave to the liver;


<a id="orge751bd6"></a>

## Leviticus 1:9

The entrails and feet being washed with water. And the priest shall burn them upon the altar for a holocaust, and a sweet savour to the Lord.


<a id="orge02f295"></a>

## Leviticus 1:10

And if the offering be of the flocks, a holocaust of sheep or of goats, he shall offer a male without blemish.


<a id="org8e29f06"></a>

## Leviticus 1:11

And he shall immolate it at the side of the altar that looketh to the north, before the Lord: but the sons of Aaron shall pour the blood thereof upon the altar round about.


<a id="org875064c"></a>

## Leviticus 1:12

And they shall divide the joints, the head, and all that cleave to the liver: and shall lay them upon the wood, under which the fire is to be put.


<a id="org99bb59e"></a>

## Leviticus 1:13

But the entrails and the feet they shall wash with water. And the priest shall offer it all and burn it all upon the altar for a holocaust, and most sweet savour to the Lord.


<a id="orgffa3fc2"></a>

## Leviticus 1:14

But if the oblation of a holocaust to the Lord be of birds, of turtles, or of young pigeons:


<a id="orgf9b85fc"></a>

## Leviticus 1:15

The priest shall offer it at the altar: and twisting back the neck, and breaking the place of the wound, he shall make the blood run down upon the brim of the altar.


<a id="org037a491"></a>

## Leviticus 1:16

But the crop of the throat, and the feathers he shall cast beside the altar at the east side, in the place where the ashes are wont to be poured out.


<a id="org499ab73"></a>

## Leviticus 1:17

And he shall break the pinions thereof, and shall not cut, nor divide it with a knife: and shall burn it upon the altar, putting fire under the wood. It is a holocaust and oblation of most sweet savour to the Lord. 


<a id="org059a43c"></a>

# Leviticus 2


<a id="org7e7519c"></a>

## Leviticus 2:1

When any one shall offer an oblation of sacrifice to the Lord, his offering shall be of fine flour: and he shall pour oil upon it, and put frankincense,


<a id="org218b855"></a>

## Leviticus 2:2

And shall bring it to the sons of Aaron the priests. And one of them shall take a handful of the flour and oil, and all the frankincense; and shall put it a memorial upon the altar for a most sweet savour to the Lord.


<a id="org29e2c72"></a>

## Leviticus 2:3

And the remnant of the sacrifice shall be Aaron&rsquo;s, and his sons&rsquo;, holy of holies of the offerings of the Lord.


<a id="org6685638"></a>

## Leviticus 2:4

But when thou offerest a sacrifice baked in the oven of flour, to wit, loaves without leaven, tempered with oil, and unleavened wafers, anointed with oil:


<a id="org0baac38"></a>

## Leviticus 2:5

If thy oblation be from the fryingpan, of flour tempered with oil, and without leaven:


<a id="orgf981929"></a>

## Leviticus 2:6

Thou shalt divide it into little pieces, and shalt pour oil upon it.


<a id="org323f530"></a>

## Leviticus 2:7

And if the sacrifice be from the gridiron, in like manner the flour shall be tempered with oil.


<a id="org10f9a72"></a>

## Leviticus 2:8

And when thou offerest it to the Lord, thou shalt deliver it to the hands of the priest.


<a id="org8b1d4eb"></a>

## Leviticus 2:9

And when he hath offered it, he shall take a memorial out of the sacrifice, and burn it upon the altar for a sweet savour to the Lord.


<a id="org8a4ec82"></a>

## Leviticus 2:10

And whatsoever is left, shall be Aaron&rsquo;s, and his sons&rsquo;: holy of holies of the offerings of the Lord.


<a id="org7ffb6b8"></a>

## Leviticus 2:11

Every oblation that is offered to the Lord shall be made without leaven: neither shall any leaven or honey be burnt in the sacrifice to the Lord.


<a id="org9ead3ea"></a>

## Leviticus 2:12

You shall offer only the firstfruits of them and gifts: but they shall not be put upon the altar, for a savour of sweetness.


<a id="orgc235be1"></a>

## Leviticus 2:13

Whatsoever sacrifice thou offerest, thou shalt season it with salt: neither shalt thou take away the salt of the covenant of thy God from thy sacrifice. In all thy oblations thou shalt offer salt.

<a id="orge4176e3"></a>

## Leviticus 10:7

<a id="org0b2ce4f"></a>

## Leviticus 10:9

And that you may have knowledge to discern between holy and unholy, between unclean and clean:


<a id="org04dedba"></a>

And you shall eat it in a holy place: which is given to thee and thy sons of the oblations of the Lord, as it hath been commanded me.

The breast also that is offered, and the shoulder that is separated, you shall eat in a most clean place, thou and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee. For they are set aside for thee and thy children, of the victims of peace offerings of the children of Israel.


<a id="org4bc01d9"></a>

## Leviticus 10:15

## Leviticus 10:16

While these things were a doing, when Moses sought for the buck goat, that had been offered for sin, he found it burnt. And being angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron that were left, he said:


<a id="orgd1732f6"></a>

## Leviticus 10:17

Why did you not eat in the holy place the sacrifice for sin, which is most holy, and given to you, that you may bear the iniquity of the people, and may pray for them in the sight of the Lord.


<a id="org248c3ae"></a>

## Leviticus 10:18

Especially, whereas none of the blood thereof hath been carried within the holy places: and you ought to have eaten it in the sanctuary, as was commanded me?


<a id="org184e877"></a>

## Leviticus 10:19

Aaron answered: This day hath been offered the victim for sin, and the holocaust before the Lord: and to me what thou seest has happened. How could I eat it, or please the Lord in the ceremonies, having a sorrowful heart?

<a id="org30497dd"></a>

## Leviticus 13:3

And if he see the leprosy in his skin, and the hair turned white and the place where the leprosy appears lower than the skin and the rest of the flesh: it is the stroke of the leprosy, and upon his judgment he shall be separated.

<a id="org62b859b"></a>

## Leviticus 13:11

<a id="org82bf8bf"></a>

## Leviticus 13:20

<a id="org1b5045f"></a>

## Leviticus 13:31

But if he perceive the place of the spot is equal with the flesh that is near it, and the hair black: he shall shut him up seven days,


<a id="org3674c68"></a>

## Leviticus 24:14

Saying: Bring forth the blasphemer without the camp: and let them that heard him, put their hands upon his head: and let all the people stone him.


<a id="org78c087e"></a>

## Leviticus 24:15

And thou shalt speak to the children of Israel: The man that curseth his God, shall bear his sin:


<a id="org25a8d27"></a>

## Leviticus 24:16

And he that blasphemeth the name of the Lord, dying let him die. All the multitude shall stone him, whether he be a native or a stranger. He that blasphemeth the name of the Lord, dying let him die.

## Leviticus 24:17

He that striketh and killeth a man: dying let him die.


<a id="org4046ec6"></a>

## Leviticus 24:18

He that killeth a beast, shall make it good that is to say, shall give beast for beast.


<a id="orgce8d51e"></a>

## Leviticus 24:19

He that giveth a blemish to any of his neighbours: as he hath done, so shall it be done to him:


<a id="org5ee628a"></a>

## Leviticus 24:20

Breach for breach, eye for ere, tooth for tooth, shall he restore. What blemish he gave, the like shall he be compelled to suffer.


<a id="orgcec5d71"></a>

## Leviticus 24:21

He that striketh a beast, shall render another. He that striketh a man shall be punished.


<a id="org39dcd37"></a>

## Leviticus 24:22

Let there be equal judgment among you, whether he be a stranger, or a native that offends: because I am the Lord your God.


<a id="org49a4e68"></a>

## Leviticus 24:23

And Moses spoke to the children of Israel. And they brought forth him that had blasphemed, without the camp: and they stoned him. And the children of Israel did as the Lord had commanded Moses.

# Leviticus 25


<a id="org5f55c5e"></a>

## Leviticus 25:1

And the Lord spoke to Moses in mount Sinai, saying:


<a id="org28de334"></a>

## Leviticus 25:2

Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them: When you shall have entered into the land which I will give you, observe the rest of the sabbath of the Lord.


<a id="orgf9f9122"></a>

## Leviticus 25:3

Six years thou shalt sow thy field and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard, and shalt gather the fruits thereof.


<a id="orgdf3a88b"></a>

## Leviticus 25:4

But in the seventh year there shall be a sabbath to the land, of the resting of the Lord. Thou shalt not sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard.


<a id="orgde40443"></a>

## Leviticus 25:5

What the ground shall bring forth of itself, thou shalt not reap: neither shalt thou gather the grapes or the firstfruits as a vintage. For it is a year of rest to the land.


<a id="org191976c"></a>

## Leviticus 25:6

But they shall be unto you for meat, to thee and to thy manservant, to thy maidservant and thy hireling, and to the strangers that sojourn with thee.

## Leviticus 25:7

All things that grow shall be meat to thy beasts and to thy cattle.


<a id="orgb0993e7"></a>

Thou shalt also number to thee seven weeks of years: that is to say, seven times seven, which together make forty-nine years.


<a id="orgefae79e"></a>

## Leviticus 25:9

And thou shalt sound the trumpet in the seventh month, the tenth day of the month, in the time of the expiation in all your land.


<a id="org9482c24"></a>

## Leviticus 25:10

And thou shalt sanctify the fiftieth year, and shalt proclaim remission to all the inhabitants of thy land: for it is the year of jubilee. Every man shall return to his possession, and every one shall go back to his former family:


<a id="orgde2c11c"></a>

## Leviticus 25:11

Because it is the jubilee and the fiftieth year. You shall not sow, nor reap the things that grow in the field of their own accord, neither shall you gather the firstfruits of the vines,


<a id="orgdc0aef0"></a>

## Leviticus 25:12

Because of the sanctification of the jubilee. But as they grow you shall presently eat them.


<a id="org7a1b7d6"></a>

## Leviticus 25:13

In the year of the jubilee all shall return to their possessions.


<a id="org626ca70"></a>

## Leviticus 25:14

## Leviticus 25:15

And he shall sell to thee according to the computation of the fruits.


<a id="orgf1815f7"></a>

## Leviticus 25:16

The more years remain after the jubilee, the more shall the price increase: and the less time is counted, so much the less shall the purchase cost. For he shall sell to thee the time of the fruits.


<a id="orgf8c79c7"></a>

## Leviticus 25:17

Do not afflict your countrymen: but let every one fear his God. Because I am the Lord your God.


<a id="orgf7866a4"></a>

## Leviticus 25:18

Do my precepts, and keep my judgments, and fulfil them: that you may dwell in the land without any fear.


<a id="orgf4cc358"></a>

## Leviticus 25:19

And the ground may yield you its fruits, of which you may eat your fill, fearing no man&rsquo;s invasion.


<a id="org8e2d36d"></a>

## Leviticus 25:20

But if you say: What shall we eat the seventh year, if we sow not, nor gather our fruits?


<a id="org5d40466"></a>

## Leviticus 25:21

I will give you my blessing the sixth year: and it shall yield the fruits of three years.


<a id="org391d610"></a>

## Leviticus 25:22

And the eighth year you shall sow, and shall eat of the old fruits, until the ninth year: till new grow up, you shall eat the old store.


<a id="org9b9738b"></a>

## Leviticus 25:23

The land also shall not be sold for ever: because it is mine, and you are strangers and sojourners with me.


<a id="orgb84d325"></a>

## Leviticus 25:24

For which cause all the country of your possession shall be under the condition of redemption.


<a id="orgb608e19"></a>

## Leviticus 25:25

If thy brother being impoverished sell his little possession, and his kinsman will: he may redeem what he had sold.


<a id="orgf2e74d7"></a>

## Leviticus 25:26

But if he have no kinsman, and he himself can find the price to redeem it:


<a id="orgf2edfe5"></a>

## Leviticus 25:27

The value of the fruits shall be counted from that time when he sold it. And the overplus he shall restore to the buyer, and so shall receive his possession again.


<a id="org611cd52"></a>

## Leviticus 25:28

But if his hands find not the means to repay the price, the buyer shall have what he bought, until the year of the jubilee. For in that year all that is sold shall return to the owner, and to the ancient possessor.


<a id="org009bee7"></a>

## Leviticus 25:29

He that selleth a house within the walls of a city, shall have the liberty to redeem it, until one year be expired.

## Leviticus 25:30

If he redeem it not, and the whole year be fully out, the buyer shall possess it, and his posterity for ever, and it cannot be redeemed, not even in the jubilee.


<a id="org266a819"></a>

## Leviticus 25:31

But if the house be in a village, that hath no walls, it shall be sold according to the same law as the fields. If it be not redeemed before, in the jubilee it shall return to the owner.


<a id="org2cb2a52"></a>

## Leviticus 25:32

The houses of Levites, which are in cities, may always be redeemed.


<a id="org60eec06"></a>

## Leviticus 25:33

If they be not redeemed, in the jubilee they shall all return to the owners: because the houses of the cities of the Levites are for their possessions among the children of Israel.


<a id="org2fc396d"></a>

## Leviticus 25:34

But let not their suburbs be sold, because it is a perpetual possession.


<a id="orgdc90e27"></a>

## Leviticus 25:35

If thy brother be impoverished, and weak of hand, and thou receive him as a stranger and sojourner, and he live with thee:


<a id="org7293d8d"></a>

## Leviticus 25:36

Take not usury of him nor more than thou gavest. Fear thy God, that thy brother may live with thee.


<a id="org7731018"></a>

## Leviticus 25:37

Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury: nor exact of him any increase of fruits.


<a id="org38320e4"></a>

## Leviticus 25:38

I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, that I might give you the land of Chanaan, and might be your God.


<a id="org31750cb"></a>

## Leviticus 25:39

If thy brother constrained by poverty, sell himself to thee: thou shalt not oppress him with the service of bondservants.


<a id="org2fa8edb"></a>

## Leviticus 25:40

But he shall be as a hireling, and a sojourner: he shall work with thee until the year of the jubilee.


<a id="orgad6be02"></a>

## Leviticus 25:41

And afterwards he shall go out with his children: and shall return to his kindred and to the possession of his fathers.


<a id="orge17141c"></a>

For they are my servants, and I brought them out of the land of Egypt: let them not be sold as bondmen.

Afflict him not by might: but fear thy God.

## Leviticus 25:44

Let your bondmen, and your bondwomen, be of the nations that are round about you:


<a id="org4f3f0c0"></a>

## Leviticus 25:45

And of the strangers that sojourn among you, or that were born of them in your land. These you shall have for servants:


<a id="org7bbec1d"></a>

## Leviticus 25:46

And by right of inheritance shall leave them to your posterity, and shall possess them for ever. But oppress not your brethren the children of Israel by might.


<a id="orgc6cd920"></a>

## Leviticus 25:47

If the hand of a stranger or a sojourner grow strong among you, and thy brother being impoverished sell himself to him, or to any of his race:


<a id="org2282868"></a>

## Leviticus 25:48

After the sale he may be redeemed. He that will of his brethren shall redeem him:


<a id="org9544e3e"></a>

## Leviticus 25:49

Either his uncle, or his uncle&rsquo;s son, or his kinsman, by blood, or by affinity. But if he himself be able also, he shall redeem himself:


<a id="org37dc0c5"></a>

## Leviticus 25:50

Counting only the years from the time of his selling unto the year of the jubilee: and counting the money that he was sold for, according to the number of the years and the reckoning of a hired servant.


<a id="org8c32ee2"></a>

## Leviticus 25:51

If there be many years that remain until the jubilee, according to them shall he also repay the price.


<a id="orgb6a56b1"></a>

## Leviticus 25:52

If few, he shall make the reckoning with him according to the number of the years: and shall repay to the buyer of what remaineth of the years.


<a id="org78468cf"></a>

## Leviticus 25:53

His wages being allowed for which he served before: he shall not afflict him violently in thy sight.


<a id="org5c98b3b"></a>

## Leviticus 25:54

And if by these means he cannot be redeemed, in the year of the jubilee he shall go out with his children.


<a id="orgfe8bbd6"></a>

## Leviticus 25:55

For the children of Israel are my servants, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt.

I will look on you, and make you increase: you shall be multiplied, and I will establish my covenant with you.

If it be a man from twenty years old unto sixty years old, he shall give fifty sicles of silver, after the weight of the sanctuary:

And if he vow the field of his possession, and consecrate it to the Lord, the price shall be rated according to the measure of the seed. If the ground be sown with thirty bushels of barley, let it be sold for fifty sicles of silver.

If he vow his field immediately from the year of jubilee that is beginning: as much as it may be worth, at so much it shall be rated.

And if he that had vowed, will redeem his field, he shall add the fifth part of the money of the estimation, and shall possess it.

If a field that was bought, and not of a man&rsquo;s ancestors&rsquo; possession, be sanctified to the Lord:
