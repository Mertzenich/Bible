And you, when you were dead in your offences and sins,


<a id="orgc30dffa"></a>

<a id="org6217490"></a>

## Ephesians 2:3

In which also we all conversed in time past, in the desires of our flesh, fulfilling the will of the flesh and of our thoughts, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest:

But God (who is rich in mercy) for his exceeding charity wherewith he loved us

## Ephesians 2:10

For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus in good works, which God hath prepared that we should walk in them.


<a id="org41d460b"></a>

## Ephesians 2:11

For which cause be mindful that you, being heretofore gentiles is the flesh, who are called uncircumcision by that which is called circumcision in the flesh, made by hands:


<a id="org629f990"></a>

## Ephesians 2:12

That you were at that time without Christ, being aliens from the conversation of Israel and strangers to the testament, having no hope of the promise and without God in this world.


<a id="org98fac06"></a>

## Ephesians 2:13

But now in Christ Jesus, you, who some time were afar off, are made nigh by the blood of Christ.


<a id="org931c8bf"></a>

## Ephesians 2:14

For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and breaking down the middle wall of partition, the enmities in his flesh:


<a id="orgd1a669c"></a>

## Ephesians 2:15

Making void the law of commandments contained in decrees: that he might make the two in himself into one new man, making peace

## Ephesians 2:16

And might reconcile both to God in one body by the cross, killing the enmities in himself.

And coming, he preached peace to you that were afar off: and peace to them that were nigh.

## Ephesians 2:20

Built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone:


<a id="org83f2e43"></a>

## Ephesians 2:21

In whom all the building, being framed together, groweth up into an holy temple in the Lord.


<a id="org2b27f9a"></a>

## Ephesians 2:22

In whom you also are built together into an habitation of God in the Spirit. 


<a id="org8422e5d"></a>

# Ephesians 3


<a id="org27ee01e"></a>

## Ephesians 3:1

For this cause, I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ, for you Gentiles:


<a id="org09e9444"></a>

## Ephesians 3:2

If yet you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me towards you:


<a id="org75c5c74"></a>

## Ephesians 3:3

How that, according to revelation, the mystery has been made known to me, as I have written above in a few words:


<a id="org705ac1d"></a>

## Ephesians 3:4

As you reading, may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ,


<a id="orge7d4408"></a>

## Ephesians 3:5

Which in other generations was not known to the sons of men, as it is now revealed to his holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit:


<a id="org9832ab1"></a>

## Ephesians 3:6

That the Gentiles should be fellow heirs and of the same body: and copartners of his promise in Christ Jesus, by the gospel


<a id="org83ebdfa"></a>

## Ephesians 3:7

Of which I am made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God, which is given to me according to the operation of his power.


<a id="org57af38f"></a>

## Ephesians 3:8

To me, the least of all the saints, is given this grace, to preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ:


<a id="orgcb32618"></a>

## Ephesians 3:9

And to enlighten all men, that they may see what is the dispensation of the mystery which hath been hidden from eternity in God who created all things:


<a id="org4acca72"></a>

## Ephesians 3:10

That the manifold wisdom of God may be made known to the principalities and powers in heavenly places through the church,


<a id="orged4839f"></a>

## Ephesians 3:11

According to the eternal purpose which he made in Christ Jesus our Lord:


<a id="org22e4fa9"></a>

## Ephesians 3:12

In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him.


<a id="org076d64d"></a>

## Ephesians 3:13

Wherefore I pray you not to faint at my tribulations for you, which is your glory.


<a id="org11ffafb"></a>

## Ephesians 3:14

For this cause I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,


<a id="org14c25fc"></a>

## Ephesians 3:15

Of whom all paternity in heaven and earth is named:


<a id="org82a4c79"></a>

## Ephesians 3:16

That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened by his Spirit with might unto the inward man:


<a id="orgf909f9d"></a>

## Ephesians 3:17

That Christ may dwell by faith in your hearts: that, being rooted and founded in charity,


<a id="org6754ff6"></a>

## Ephesians 3:18

You may be able to comprehend, with all the saints, what is the breadth and length and height and depth,


<a id="orgdeffeb8"></a>

## Ephesians 3:19

To know also the charity of Christ, which surpasseth all knowledge: that you may be filled unto all the fulness of God.


<a id="org701d7d3"></a>

## Ephesians 3:20

Now to him who is able to do all things more abundantly than we desire or understand, according to the power that worketh in us:


<a id="org5258a47"></a>

## Ephesians 3:21

To him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus, unto all generations, world without end. Amen. 


<a id="orge8eb79e"></a>

# Ephesians 4


<a id="org53fc6bb"></a>

## Ephesians 4:1

I therefore, a prisoner in the Lord, beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation in which you are called:


<a id="orgd765de9"></a>

## Ephesians 4:2

With all humility and mildness, with patience, supporting one another in charity.


<a id="orgdcc833c"></a>

## Ephesians 4:3

Careful to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.


<a id="org84dc958"></a>

## Ephesians 4:4

One body and one Spirit: as you are called in one hope of your calling.


<a id="org3db9422"></a>

## Ephesians 4:5

One Lord, one faith, one baptism.


<a id="orgb0630d3"></a>

## Ephesians 4:6

One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in us all.


<a id="orgc0c7ef5"></a>

## Ephesians 4:7

But to every one of us is given grace, according to the measure of the giving of Christ.


<a id="orgdb8b500"></a>

## Ephesians 4:8

Wherefore he saith: Ascending on high, he led captivity captive: he gave gifts to men.


<a id="orga345e25"></a>

## Ephesians 4:9

Now that he ascended, what is it, but because he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?


<a id="org992c2de"></a>

## Ephesians 4:10

He that descended is the same also that ascended above all the heavens: that he might fill all things.


<a id="org6c1970d"></a>

## Ephesians 4:11

And he gave some apostles, and some prophets, and other some evangelists, and other some pastors and doctors:


<a id="orgd993d7d"></a>

## Ephesians 4:12

For the perfecting of the saints, for the word of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:


<a id="org5c818f5"></a>

## Ephesians 4:13

Until we all meet into the unity of faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the age of the fulness of Christ:


<a id="org5dafa7e"></a>

## Ephesians 4:14

That henceforth we be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the wickedness of men, by cunning craftiness by which they lie in wait to deceive.


<a id="org10cb86a"></a>

## Ephesians 4:15

But doing the truth in charity, we may in all things grow up in him who is the head, even Christ:


<a id="orgd14fb8b"></a>

## Ephesians 4:16

From whom the whole body, being compacted and fitly joined together, by what every joint supplieth, according to the operation in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body, unto the edifying of itself in charity.


<a id="orga8f9e2d"></a>

## Ephesians 4:17

This then I say and testify in the Lord: That henceforward you walk not as also the Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind:


<a id="org68acae7"></a>

## Ephesians 4:18

Having their understanding darkened: being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their hearts.

Be ye therefore followers of God, as most dear children:


<a id="org13c6190"></a>

<a id="orgfead164"></a>

## Ephesians 5:3

But fornication and all uncleanness or covetousness, let it not so much as be named among you, as becometh saints:


<a id="org0bbf7f8"></a>

Proving what is well pleasing to God.

## Ephesians 5:11

And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness: but rather reprove them.


<a id="org6060bff"></a>

## Ephesians 5:12

For the things that are done by them in secret, it is a shame even to speak of.

<a id="org0686fc4"></a>

## Ephesians 5:22

Let women be subject to their husbands, as to the Lord:


<a id="org61ce38d"></a>

Because the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ is the head of the church. He is the saviour of his body.


<a id="org7646a5e"></a>

## Ephesians 5:24

Therefore as the church is subject to Christ: so also let the wives be to their husbands in all things.


<a id="orgdaf1b5e"></a>

## Ephesians 5:25

Husbands, love your wives, as Christ also loved the church and delivered himself up for it:

That he might sanctify it, cleansing it by the laver of water in the word of life:


<a id="orgd451b79"></a>

<a id="orgb63786b"></a>

## Ephesians 5:29

For no man ever hated his own flesh, but nourisheth and cherisheth it, as also Christ doth the church:


<a id="org308408f"></a>

## Ephesians 5:30

Because we are members of him, body, of his flesh and of his bones.


<a id="org3b88db4"></a>

## Ephesians 5:31

For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother: and shall cleave to his wife. And they shall be two in one flesh.


<a id="orgd5ce858"></a>

## Ephesians 5:32

This is a great sacrament: but I speak in Christ and in the church.


<a id="orgd143365"></a>

Nevertheless, let every one of you in particular love for his wife as himself: And let the wife fear her husband.
